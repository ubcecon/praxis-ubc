regina_v_wing_chong.txt,Crease,case,"CREASE, J. 1885. REGINA v. WING CHONG. 

14th & 15th July, Certiorari—“Chinese Regulation Act, 1884,” s. 5—Constitutionality—B.N.A. Act, 1867, ss. 91, 92—“Aliens”—“Trade and Commerce”—Taxation. 
On the return to a writ of certiorari. Held, that the “Chinese Regulation Act, 1884,” is ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature, on the following grounds: 
1. It is an interference with the rights of Aliens. 
2. It is an interference with Trade and Commerce. 
3. It is an infraction of the existing treaties between the Imperial Government and China. 
4. It imposes unequal taxation. 

14th & 15th July—On the return of a writ of certiorari directed to Edwin Johnson, Esquire, Police Magistrate for the City of Victoria, to return into this Court a certain conviction made by him under which one Wing Chong was fined $20 for not having in his possession a license issued under the “Chinese Regulation Act, 1884.”

The Attorney-General in support of the conviction said there were five points raised on the rule for the certiorari against the validity of the $10 tax.—1st. That it interfered with the Dominion powers under the B. N. A. Act, aliens, and naturalization; 2nd. Trade and commerce; 3rd. Treaty obligations; 4th. That the tax was unequal, and 5th. It was indirect taxation. As to the first point aliens were as much subject to taxation as citizens. Protection and taxation were reciprocal (Cooley on Taxation, p. 14). The law did not deal with the conditions under which aliens might acquire rights or become subjects of Her Majesty. Secondly—Trade and commerce were not interfered with. The object of the Act was two-fold, the police and sanitary regulation of a numerous foreign element, and the raising of revenue necessary to meet that regulation (Hodge v. The Queen, L. R. 9, App. Cas. 117). If incidentally trade and commerce were touched, the provincial power of direct taxation was not impaired (Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons, L. R. 7 App. Cas. 108). The preamble and scope of the Act showed its objects were purely matters of the police and raising of revenue to meet the necessary expenditure, and within “Direct Taxation.” Thirdly—The treaty obligations of England did not affect the question. The last communication from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor-General, dated 16th May, 1884, stated, in effect, that the Colonies with responsible government could pass restrictive laws irrespective of treaties (B. C. Sessional Papers, 1885, p. 464), and instanced the legislation of the Australian Colonies and of the Dominion. Fourthly—As to unequal taxation, the power of the Province within its jurisdiction was supreme and as plenary as that of the Imperial Parliament (R. v. Burah, L.R. 3 App. Cas. 904; R. v. Hodge, L. R. 9, App. Cas. 117; and Powell v. Apollo Candle Co., L.R. 10 App. Cas., p. 290; and *In re Goodhue*, 19 Gr. 366); *Cooley* on Taxation, pp. 3, 82, 126-128, and *Cooley's Constitutional Limitations* (5th Ed.) 626-7; *Sedgwick* on Stat. (2nd Ed.), p. 501; *Potter's Dwarris* 418, 421, 425; *Dow v. Black*, L. R. 6 P. C. 272, were cited as showing the power of taxation, unless abridged by the written constitution, might be exercised so as to discriminate. The Supreme Court of Canada, in the case of *Jonas v. Gilbert*, 5 S. C. R., 356, had practically decided the same point. Fifthly—Whether called a licence or not, the imposition was a direct poll tax, and as such came within the power of the Province to raise money by direct taxation for Provincial purposes. *Cooley* on Taxation, 386; *Wharton's Law Lexicon*; *Reed v. Mousseau*, 8 S. C. R., 408. It was not a license to carry on business, or a method whereby indirectly money was raised from the consumer, as, for instance, customs or stamp laws.

*Richards*, Q. C., for Wing Chong—The object of the Act was not for police purposes or to raise revenue. Its object, though not apparent on the face of the Act, was to prevent Chinese coming into the Province and drive out those who had already come. He reviewed the legislation against Chinese since confederation, contending it was levelled against a particular race of aliens and, therefore, beyond provincial control, per *Gwynne*, J., in *Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons*, 4 S. C. R., at p. 346. The law was a direct interference with trade and commerce (*R. v. Severn*, 2 Can. S. C. R., 70). If its object were successful and Chinese driven from the country, the customs dues received from the Chinese would be lost and the benefits of trade relations enjoyed by the merchants would be destroyed. Counsel cited statistics from the Chinese Commission showing the extreme importance, from a fiscal and commercial point of view, of the large number of Chinese in the Province. The Dominion under the B. N. A. Act had alone the right of performing in Canada the obligations of Canada as part of the British Empire in respect of treaties, and although Canada might pass laws prohibiting immigration, or having that tendency, the Province could not do so, nor could it pass laws in derogation of treaties. He cited the British treaty (25th August, 1842, from *Hertslet*, Vol. 6, and Lord *Elgin's* treaty, 1860), comparing it with the *Burlingame* treaty of the United States, and quoted California decisions (*Lin Sing v. Washburn*, 20 Cal. 334), and the decision of *Gray*, J., in *Tai Sing v. Maguire*, deciding that similar legislation was held void as contravening the treaty and the sovereign power to regulate trade and commerce with foreign countries. 

*Drake*, Q. C., on the same side, argued that the imposition of the $10 tax was invalid because of inequality. Inherent in and incidental to the taxing power was the characteristic of equality. *Cooley* stated that irrespective of constitutional limitation a particular class of citizens could not be burdened for the advantage of others—*Cooley's Constitutional Limitations*, p. 635. This was a principle underlying the power to tax and governing that right even though the CREASE, J. 1885. REGINA v. WING CHONG. written constitution made no mention of it—Cooley on Taxation, p. 18, and City of Lexington v. McQuillan, 35 Am. Dec. 159. The imposition was in derogation of treaty rights with which Canada alone had the power to deal. The Australian legislation did not help the contention of the Attorney-General. The Australian Colonies were autonomous, and occupied the same position as that of Canada. The Provinces were not autonomous. He did not contend that the whole of the Act was invalid. Much of it was within the scope of the Province, notably the provisions affecting the size of dwellings, the forbidding the use of opium, and the desecration of grave-yards. He insisted that imposing excessive taxation on one class of citizens was unconstitutional. The remarks of Chief Justice Ritchie, in the case of Jonas v. Gilbert before the Supreme Court of Canada, were obiter dicta, as the decision was upon another point, and intimated, but did not decide the right of the Provinces to discriminate, nor in what things and to what extent discrimination in taxation was legitimate. Lastly, the Act was for indirect taxation, which was a power given only to the Dominion Parliament. It was a license fee, the power to impose which had, in Severn v. The Queen, been decided against the Provinces on the score of such legislation being against trade and commerce. 

The Attorney-General in reply—The ten dollar impost was a tax whether designated by the name of a licence or otherwise. The distinction between direct and indirect taxation was well drawn in the case of Reed v. Mousseau before the Supreme Court of Canada, in which Mr. Justice Strong mentioned the Privy Council had decided the Provincial legislatures had exclusive power to impose direct taxation, and that it did not follow they might not have power even to impose indirect taxation. The tax did not sanction the carrying on of any business out of the product of which the consumer would, indirectly, contribute towards payment of the tax. Then as to inequality, the one dictum of Cooley was but an expression of opinion that political wisdom required uniform taxation; for the same author cited numerous authorities, including that of the Supreme Court of the United States establishing the right to discriminate unless fettered by the express language of the Constitution. Todd on Parliamentary Government in the Colonies, supported the view that the Provinces within their jurisdiction were as omnipotent as the Imperial Parliament. The California cases (see The People v. Naglee, 1 Cal. 232) decided a differential tax might be imposed on foreign miners; and though a later case (Lin Sing v. Washburn, 20 Cal. 334) had decided a special tax could not be imposed on Chinese, a most celebrated Judge, Mr. Justice Field (since elevated to the Federal bench), dissented, and had pointed out that according to federal decisions the State might impose special taxation on alien residents, provided the impost was not levied against foreigners landing in the country. The tax was not to exclude the Chinese — another statute with that object had been disallowed. It was imposed to meet the extraordinary expenses incident to enforcing the police and sanitary regulations prescribed by the Act. The question of treaties had nothing to do with the subject, for to responsible governments the Imperial Authorities conceded the right to pass laws within their jurisdiction. So the Canadian Parliament to-day was passing a restriction Act. Opponents to the Act might as well contend the exclusion of the Chinese from the franchise, and barring them from acquiring lands, was illegal. As to autonomy, neither the Australian Colonies nor the Dominion were absolutely possessed, but the Province equally with Australia and the Dominion were autonomous within the bounds of their respective jurisdictions. 

21st August, 1885—CREASE, J.— In order to deal satisfactorily with the questions raised by this appeal, it is necessary to see what is the scope and purport of the Act."" It starts with a recital, in itself a petio principii—not apparently the result of any public enquiry—which charges them with being not law-abiding, dissimilar in habits and occupation to the whites—useless in emergencies, habitual desecrators of grave-yards, unsuited to our laws, and of habits subversive of the community. From that premises concluding that special laws are required for their government, it proceeds to enact:— 

The only schedule is the form of license, which runs as follows:—

The question now raised on the construction of this Act affects not only British Columbia, but, as she occupies the only Pacific seaboard of the Dominion, indirectly more or less the very many other Provinces under the flag of confederation. 
Taking for convenience the five points of objection to the conviction in the order in which they are made— 
1. That it interfered with the Dominion powers under the B. N. A. Act over aliens and naturalization. 
2. Trade and commerce. 
3. Treaty obligations. 
4. That the tax was unequal. 
5. That it was indirect taxation and therefore illegal, and should be quashed. 

On the first point, I would observe that it is now well settled law that British Columbia, as a part of the Dominion, possesses all, but possesses only, the powers which are strictly defined by the B. N. A. Act of 1867, which is, indeed, the constitution of Canada.

Neither she nor any other of the Provinces possess any other powers of legislation than are conferred by that Act. If British Columbia, or any other Province, in its legislation, goes beyond that Act and in excess of its provisions, that moment, and to the extent of such transgression, it ceases to be law. Therefore, in dealing with this question, our constitutional Act must be kept in view throughout, as the measure by which we must continually gauge the legality or illegality of the provisions of the local statute under consideration. 

The Act of Federation was passed in order to be an irrefragable, permanent standard by which to preserve and regulate all the relative rights of the Provinces, as among themselves and as regards the Dominion. 

The exclusive powers of that Act given to the Dominion over particular subjects are contained in the 91st section. The exclusive powers of the Province are particularized in section 92. It is natural that in the working out of such a constitution in a new and growing country, questions should be continually cropping up, and call upon the Courts to define gradually and with greater exactness, as time progresses and population expands, the relative powers given by the Act to the Dominion and Provinces respectively. Sub-section 2 of section 91 gives to the Dominion Parliament exclusively the regulation of “trade and commerce,” and by sub-section 25 that of “naturalization and aliens,” and everything relating to those subjects as affecting the whole Dominion is within the Dominion powers, and no local Legislature can make any statute interfering with either of those subjects. If it does, so far as such interference extends it is illegal and void, and when brought before the Court it is the duty of that tribunal so to adjudge it.

And the converse of this is true when applied to Dominion legislation as affecting the subjects exclusively given by the constitution to the Province. 

Now, applying this test to the statute before us, let us see whether and how far its provisions affect, as is alleged, aliens, or trade, or commerce. 

The aliens in this case being Chinese, the first enquiry must be, what is the object of the Act? On applying to the preamble, we find that it looks like a bill of indictment as against a race not suited to live among a civilized nation, and certainly does not prepare one for legislation which would encourage or tolerate their settlement in the country. Indeed, the first lines of the preamble sound an alarm at the multitude of people coming in, who are of the repulsive habits described in the last part of the preamble, and prepares one for measures which should have a tendency to abate that alarm by deterrent influences and enactments which should have the effect of materially lessening the number of such undesirable visitors. The provisions of the Act I have given somewhat in extenso bear out that view, and the concurrent and previous local legislation bear out the same impression, for on the same day as this Act was passed, another Act was passed, the very object of which was plainly stated to be ""to prevent the immigration"" of Chinese."" 

That Act was disallowed. It interfered with aliens as well as trade and commerce, which cannot subsist among nations without personal intercourse, which such an Act (as far as China was concerned) would have a tendency to prohibit. 

Another statute (of 1878), ""An Act to provide for the better collection of taxes from Chinese,"" which contained several of the stringent provisions which I have described in this Act, such as a special tax specially recoverable by summary and unusual remedies from the Chinese alone, in British Columbia, and enforced by fine and imprisonment and other penal clauses, came before this Court, and in a most conscientious and exhaustive judgment of Mr. Justice Gray, of 23rd September, 1878, in the case of Tai Sing v. Maguire, was declared unconstitutional and ultra vires the Local Legislature, as interfering with aliens and trade and commerce—matters reserved exclusively under the 81st section of the B. N. A. Act to the Dominion. That decision was never appealed from, and was at once acted on by the government as conclusive. 

The position and legislative powers of British Columbia have been in no respect altered in its relations to the legislative powers of the Dominion on the same subjects since that time, though Russell v. The Queen (7 App. Cas. 829) and Hodge v. The Queen (9 App. Cas. 117) have more fully defined the extent of the powers of the Provincial Legislatures than has hitherto been done; and in the latter case especially. That decision, however, was not before Mr. Gray when he rendered the judgment in Tai Sing v. Maguire. Until reversed or varied, the decision in the Hodge case is law here, and binding on this Court. 

Their lordships say (page 132), with reference to the objection of the appellants there (delegatus non potest delegare):—
""It appears to their lordships, however, that the objection thus raised by the appellants is founded on an entire misconception of the true character and position of the Provincial Legislatures. They are in no sense delegates of or acting under any mandate from the Imperial Parliament. When the British North America Act enacted that there should be a Legislature for Ontario"" (for this case we may for ""Ontario"" read ""British Columbia""), ""and that its Legislative Assembly should have exclusive authority to make laws for the Province and for provincial purposes in relation to the matters enumerated in section 92, it conferred powers not in any sense to be exercised by delegation from or as agents of the Imperial Parliament, but authority as plenary and as ample within the limits prescribed by section 92 as the Imperial Parliament in the plenitude of its power possessed and could bestow. Within these limits of subjects and area the Local Legislature is supreme."" 

[So far this decision confirms the words of Lord Selborne in R. v. Burah; what follows goes beyond it.] ""And has the same authority as the Imperial Parliament or the Parliament of the Dominion would have had under like circumstances to confide to a municipal institution or body of its own creation authority to make by-laws or resolutions as to subjects specified in the enactment, and with the object of carrying the enactment into operation and effect."" 

That decision, although in some respects an obiter dictum, as regards this case, makes it clear that within the limits of subjects and the area prescribed by the B. N. A. Act, by section 92, the Legislature of British Columbia is supreme. The basis, then, of our enquiry must be: Is this Chinese Regulation Act of 1884—rather the parts of it objected to—within the limit of subjects and area of section 92, or does it exceed those limits in which it is supreme, and interfere with aliens, trade and commerce in such a manner as to encroach on section 91 or any of its sub-sections? If so, so far as it does so, it is unconstitutional and ultra vires, and therefore void. Now it does not follow because a local Act touches on these three subjects it therefore interferes with them so as to render it unconstitutional. 

Aliens may be taxed, may be subjected to the same rules and municipal and other by-laws as other inhabitants of British Columbia, and such discrimination in so doing as are allowed in local legislatures between and among different persons and occupations among the whites are quite as applicable to them. These are the only discriminations which the law allows, and these are the permissible discriminations spoken of by Cooley in the portions cited before the Court. During the argument the case of *Lin Sing v. Washburn*, 20 California Reports, 534, was quoted as bearing on this case. There, an Act of the California Legislature passed an Act imposing a capitation tax “on ‘each person, male and female, of the Mongolian race of the age of 18 years and upwards residing in the State,’ accompanying a license almost a *fac simile* of our own, and enforced in much the same way as in the case before us, that, after long and elaborate argument in which the Attorney-General appeared for the State, was determined to be unconstitutional, as it was an interference with trade and commerce, which could be regulated alone by the general government. It was in vain advanced that at least the State had concurrent jurisdiction in matters of taxation relative to its own internal affairs, of which this was one (the same proposition as was advanced by the Attorney-General in this case) in which it had a supreme and autonomous right to legislate. And the grounds of this decision were that the federal constitution had vested in the general government the power to regulate commerce in all its branches (as with us in the Dominion); and this power extends to every species of commercial intercourse, and may be exercised upon persons as well as property (Mr. Justice Field, whose arguments have been reproduced by the Attorney-General before me in this case, dissenting). 

That commerce cannot be carried on without the agency of persons, and the tax, the effect of which is to diminish personal intercourse, is a tax on commerce. If the power to impose such a tax is acknowledged, it being a sovereign power, no limitation can be affixed to its exercise, and it may be so used as not only to diminish but destroy commerce. 

The power asserted in the Act in question (the California Act) is the right of the State to prescribe the terms upon which the Chinese shall be permitted to reside in it, and be so used as to cut off all intercourse between them and the people of the State, and defeat the commercial policy of the nation. 

That the Act could not be maintained as a police regulation; that a branch of the police power had been surrendered to the Federal Government as a part of the power to regulate commerce, and its exercise by a State was incompatible with the authority of the Government. 

That the Chinese might be taxed as other residents, but could not be set apart as special objects of the taxation, and be compelled to contribute to the revenue of the State in the character of foreigners. 

The reports of the higher California courts are of great authority for us on all Chinese questions, for there have been efforts for years past to restrict Chinese immigration in California, and the matter has been constantly before the superior courts there, and the judges there (if we may take the reports as correct) are more than ordinarily skilled in laying down the law correctly in constitutional points of that nature. Indeed, there is no other country which has such experience generally in constitutional law as applicable to a federation of states. 

Of course, in all the observations I make I recognize the now well-known distinction between the relations of a State of the Union to the Federal Government, and our relation as a Province to the Dominion. Still both Federal Governments have reserved to themselves the regulation of trade and commerce and naturalization and aliens; so the analogy is so close as to become almost a direct authority. 

In the *Lin Sin* judgment, p. 579, the learned judge says of the power of taxing foreigners, as in the present *qua* foreigners: “If the power exist it may be exercised upon all foreigners residing in the State, and may be so exercised as to bar the door of foreign commerce as effectually as the Government could do by issuing its man-“date and closing its ports."" 

And again ""to determine whether there is a conflict or not, i.e., of jurisdictions, the power must be considered with reference to its consequences, for its effect when carried out is the only criterion by which a judgment can be formed.""

In another place he says:—""It would be an empty sound to say that the several States cannot pass any law to prevent foreigners from coming here if they may pass laws which will compel such foreigners to depart as soon as they arrive."" 

And again, ""A tax imposed by the law on these persons for the mere right to reside here, is an appropriate and effective means to discourage the immigration of the Chinese into the State.""

During the argument on the case before me, the Attorney-General claims that this was direct taxation, and a direct tax within the Province, to raise revenue for Provincial purposes, and, therefore *intra vires*; but the question is not one of name but of fact. Does it interfere with trade or commerce? Can it be legally imposed on foreigners as foreigners, for even a legal tax in other respects becomes illegal when it goes beyond its proper limits, and interferes with powers exclusively given to the Dominion for the benefit of all? 

In another California case, *In re Tiburcio Parrott*, it is laid down that if the apparent object of a statute is under a pretense of the exercise of constitutional powers to drive Chinese away, the end sought to be obtained being unlawful, the statute is void. 

In *Russell v. Reg.* it is decided that the true nature and character of legislation must be determined in order to ascertain its legality. 

In *Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons*, we have to look at the legislation for the same purpose. 

If the legislation here be to drive people from the country, have the local legislature the power? Legislation as to aliens is reserved to the Dominion. And as to trade and commerce, if the Chinese be driven out an annual loss to the revenue, it appears by the tables in the Chinese Commission Report, of $110,000 will take place; and more than $1,500,000 of property and business be lost to us, besides an injury to trade to an incalculable extent. The amount of business transacted by Chinamen in British Columbia, as revealed by the tables in that Chinese Report, is something which a casual observer would have no idea of. 

The treaties between Great Britain and China, which bind us, have been quoted. The treaty of 25th August, 1842, *Hertslet*, Vol. 6, ratified 26th June, 1843, p. 221, and Lord Elgin's treaty of October, 1860, authenticated copies of which were produced in Court, secure to Chinese coming into British dominions the same ""full security for persons and property as subjects of Her Majesty."" 

*Vattell*, cap. 8, referring to our obligations to foreigners, observes:— ""As soon as the lord of the territory admits strangers into it he engages ""to protect them as his own subjects, and to afford them perfect security as far as depends on him.""

*Reg. v. Severn* and *Reg. v. Russell* are important authorities in guiding our enquiry as to the nature and effect of local legislation in determining whether and how far the Act under review exceeds the limits within which the local legislature is supreme. And as to the equality of taxation, besides *Cooley*, who has been quoted freely on both sides, in *Kent's Commentaries* (8th Ed.), 2nd Vol., 388, it is insisted—""That every person is entitled to be protected in the enjoyment of his property, not only from invasions of it by individuals, but from all unequal and undue assessments on the part of the Government. It is not sufficient that no tax or imposition can be imposed upon the citizens, but by their representatives in the legislature the citizens are entitled to require that the legislature itself shall cause all public taxation to be fair and equal in proportion to the value of 'property"" (and that is what *Cooley* means by apportionment of taxation), ""so that no class of individuals, and no species of property shall be unduly assessed."" The treaties I have quoted between Great Britain and China, binding on the Dominion and on us in British Columbia, secure to the Chinese, just as the treaties between Great Britain and other foreign countries secure to other foreigners, the same rights in regard to the equality of taxation which I have described as being enjoyed by citizens of this country. 

These treaties have the force of international law, and are continued most strongly against the party for whose benefit they are introduced. 

In the case of the Chinese treaties, they were forced at the point of the bayonet on China, to obtain a right for us to enter China, and in return for a similar permission to us, full permission was given for the Chinese to trade and reside in British dominions everywhere. 

In the treaties of 1858 and 1860, made at the solicitation of Great Britain, the Emperor of China was induced to give permission to his subjects to go and trade and reside ""in British Colonies,"" and to enter into ""engagements with British subjects for that purpose."" 

These obligations are binding here and in other parts of the Dominion under section 132 of the British North America Act, and no Province, or the Dominion itself, can lawfully pass laws interfering with that right without a previous revision of the treaties by the high contracting parties to them for that purpose. Treaties with foreign nations are above all ordinary municipal law, for obvious international reasons, for without such a provision there can be no permanent security, which is the life of all commercial intercourse. The same provisions that apply to Chinese may be made to apply also to Americans, Frenchmen, Germans, or any other foreigners. Such treaties are the especial care of the Dominion, and where local legislation clashes with that especial province of the Dominion, the legislation of the Province must give way, as laid down in Leprohon v. the City of Ottawa, 40 Q.B., Ont., 478; Reg. v. Chandler, Hannay's New Brunswick Reports, 548; Dow v. Black, L.R. 6 P.C. 272; L'Union St. Jacques v. Belisle, L.R. 6 P.C. 31, and numerous other Canadian authorities, besides the British North America Act itself. Now applying the principles and tests I have described to the Act before us, what do we find? The Act is found associated with another Act now disallowed, the express object of which is to prevent the Chinese altogether from coming to this country, and the principle ""noscitur a sociis"" is kept up by the preamble of the present Act, which describes the Chinese in terms which, I venture to think, have never before in any other country found a place in an Act of Parliament. 

In the definition of the persons affected by the Act no distinction is made of ambassadors, merchants, consuls, artists, professors or travellers, or sex, whether under disability or not, or at such a distance from a collector as to make it difficult or impossible to obtain a license. Every person of Chinese origin, whether naturalized in Hong Kong or America, or any other State with which we are at amity, so long as they are of Chinese origin, 14 years of age—every one without distinction—must take out a license. For the purpose of argument I have treated the license fee as a tax; but it is in fact a license—a license to remain in British Columbia unmolested for a year. When the legislature wanted to create a tax, they knew what words to use for the purpose, for in the sister Act passed on the same day, which was disallowed, they called the impost there enacted a ""tax,"" not a license. However difficult or impossible for any Chinese to find a district collector, if such Chinese is ""found without a license he is liable to a fine of $40."" At every turn he is confronted with an exceptional duty, and an exceptional penalty, and the loss of his goods and chattels, and of personal liberty. 

It is impossible but that such an imposition so enforced, in addition to all the general taxes to which he is subject, should make this country too hot for him to live in; and just in proportion as he is so persecuted out of the country, in that degree does this enactment interfere with trade and commerce and that control over aliens exclusively given to the Dominion. And not only is he thus attacked, but unheard of provisions are introduced. Every employé of Chinese labour, whether English, American, or what not, is made liable to severe and incessant liability of a penal kind, for what? Some act, a default of his own? No; an act or default of a stranger, a man whose language he knows not, and for every infraction of the Act by the Chinese under his employ. The palpable object of such a provision, or set of provisions, is to render the employment of Chinese so distasteful and annoying to the employer that he must cease to employ them. Now, to pass a law providing that employment shall not be given to a special class of men, except it be productive of so much danger, annoyance, and loss to the employer, is just another way of saying that no intercourse shall be had with that class. With penalties and prosecutions always before you, far in excess of any advantage to be derived from that intercourse or trade, what is that but equivalent to saying that such intercourse or trade or labour must cease altogether. What is that but interfering with aliens, trade, and commerce? 

If a man employ a Chinaman who should happen to be delinquent in his tax, and he happens to occupy a cottage or room of his employer, with his master's goods in it, under section 10 they are liable to seizure and sale. In every prosecution under the Act the legal presumption of innocence until conviction is reversed; in every case the onus probandi, though in a Statute highly penal, is shifted from the informant on to the shoulders of the accused, and he a foreigner not knowing one word of the law, or even the language of the accuser. In other words, every Chinese is guilty until proved innocent—a provision which fills one conversant with subjects with alarm; for if such a law can be tolerated as against Chinese, the precedent is set, and in time of any popular outcry can easily be acted on for putting any other foreigners or even special classes among ourselves, as coloured people, or French, Italians, Americans, or Germans, under equally the same law. That certainly is interfering with aliens. 

The proposition that it is a Provincial tax for revenue purposes, supposing it to be so intended under the provisions of the Act, is so manifestly calculated to defeat that object, by diminishing the numbers of the members of the persons to be affected by it, that it is difficult to regard it in that light, or in any other light than an indirect mode of getting rid of persons whom it affects out of the country. The whole Act teems with special provisions which affect not only Chinese, but their employers, with obligations and liabilities as to the conduct of the Chinese in their employ, that no reasonable man would encounter, and run the risk of the penal consequences which the Act hangs over him. 

For instance, by section 19 any pecuniary penalty imposed may be summarily recovered (and applies to employers), and in default of immediate payment the same may be recovered by distress of the goods and chattels of the offender, and in default of sufficient distress by a liability to imprisonment for three calendar months, and the employers would necessarily be white men. 

In fact, the Act so bristles with these arbitrary, exceptional and penal consequences, that it is invidious to single out particular ones for comment. It is enough to add that ""any person,"" no matter whether white or Chinese, imprisoned in respect of any infraction of the provisions of the Act, may be at the will of the executive, subjected even to hard labour. 

The Act is so full of provisions that interfere directly with aliens, with trade, and with commerce, that I have no hesitation in pronouncing all such provisions, and among them those under which the appellant in this case has been convicted, to be ultra vires the local legislature, and consequently illegal and void. 

So far, I have dealt with the Act on its own merits; but if we consider it in juxtaposition to the Dominion Act recently passed restricting the Chinese throughout all Canada, its illegality becomes transparent; for in passing that Act against the Chinese the Dominion has spoken by the highest authority which it possesses—its own Parliament. By the Constitutional Act the subject of aliens, we have seen, is specially reserved to the Dominion, and it is now an axiom, in the interpretation of that Act, that when that authority deals with a subject expressly included in its jurisdiction by the 91st section, it has possession of that subject exclusively, and the Province has to give way. It is a great assumption of power on the part of a Province to pass laws, the effect of which must be practically to expel a particular class of aliens from that Province, to say in effect that it will by its legislation impede or prevent that class from being employed in another Province—say the North-west Territory or Manitoba—where railway works may be languishing for want of that very class of labourers, British Columbia being the only sea-board of Canada on the Pacific through which (in face of the restrictive laws of the United States) that class of labourers can enter and pass through; that is, in fact, legislating on all inter-provincial immigration; in other words, such legislation is ultra vires, and so I pronounce it; and adjudge accordingly, and quash the conviction, with costs.

WONG HOY WOON v. DUNCAN.

1894. Oct. 22.

Health regulations—Victoria Health By-Law, 1893, Secs. 32, 35—""Infected locality""—Proof of—""Exposed to infection.""

Action of trespass against the Medical Health Officer of the City of Victoria for causing the plaintiff, one of a number of Chinamen, who landed at Victoria in a steamer last from Hong Kong in China, to be removed to the ""Suspect Station"" and there detained and subjected to cleansing process under colour of Sec. 35 of the Municipal Health By-Law, 1893, giving him, as Medical Health Officer, power ""To stop, detain and examine every person or persons, freight, cargoes, railway and tramway cars coming from a place infected with a malignant or infectious disease,"" in order to prevent the introduction of such into Victoria.

The plaintiff had been passed by the Dominion Government Quarantine Officer as entitled to land at Victoria.

The white passengers from Hong Kong on the same steamer were not interfered with. The only evidence of Hong Kong being a place infected, etc., was that of a medical man resident in Victoria, who said ""That in China small pox was endemic, because there inoculation was the universal practice. That there was danger of infection from white passengers, but not the same danger as from Chinamen."" There was no direct evidence of the existence of small pox to a dangerous extent in Hong Kong at the time of the departure thence of the steamer, or that it was ""a place infected,"" etc., or that the plaintiff had been ""exposed to infection.""

Held, That the facts were insufficient to justify the action of the Health Officer under the by-law.

Remarks on the duties of Health Officers.

Statement ACTION, claiming damages, for trespass. The facts fully appear from the head note and from the judgment.

H. Dallas Helmcken, for the plaintiff.

W. J. Taylor, for the defendant.

Judgment. CREASE, J.: This was a test action to try whether Chinamen have the same rights as other foreigners in landing here on their advent from China.

The occasion was the arrival of the Empress of China at the Outer Wharf, which is within the city limits of Victoria, on the 1st day of May, 1894, from China and Hongkong.

The action is one nominally rather than really, for damages against Dr. George Duncan, the Health Officer of the City of Victoria, on account of an alleged excess of duty in despatching en masse, without examination or enquiry, a number of Chinamen out to the suspect station at Ross Bay, there to be disinfected and scrubbed. No white passenger from the same port (Hongkong, the last port touched at) having been treated in a similar manner or apparently even questioned or detained. The Chinamen had already been examined on board the ship by the Dominion Quarantine Officers and Provincial officers and passed. Hoy Woon had also paid the $50 required by the Government as his entry fee into British Columbia, and was in possession of the proper receipt.

Dr. Duncan then appears on the scene, and finds these men already passed and landed clear of ship, Dominion Judgment customs and entrance.

Disregarding the white men, who had come at the same time from the same place and in the same ship and presumably subject to some of the same unsanitary influences, though not to the same extent as the Chinese, without any reason for special suspicion, without inspecting or attempting to inspect a single man, (that had already been done individually by the Dominion Quarantine Officers) he orders them into the custody of his constables to be taken out to the suspect station at Ross Bay, there to be washed and disinfected and scrubbed. They, with their goods and chattels, were bundled into a common truck like so many cattle.

The plaintiff and other Chinamen similarly situated obtained a writ of Habeas Corpus, upon which they were discharged from this custody.

Thereupon the present action was brought to test if and how far Chinamen are to be treated, when they land on our shores, differently from other foreigners.

The grounds alleged by the Health Officer for this arbitrary treatment is “that China is an infected locality,” and all persons coming from China and especially in this instance Hongkong, and especially also the natives of China, come from an infected locality, and that he has that authority under the Health By-Law, 1893, which was passed at the time of the small pox panic in Victoria, and, in all he did, was simply doing his duty.

Section 32 of that by-law (published in the B.C. Gazette of April 20, 1893) directs a strict examination to be made of any vessel and persons coming from “an infected locality,” before any person, luggage or freight or other thing is allowed to be landed from it.

Section 35 of the Health By-Law of 1893 gives the Medical Health Officer power to stop, detain and examine every person or persons, freight, cargoes, railway and tramway cars coming from a place “infected with a malignant Judgment. pestilential or infectious disease,” in order to prevent the introduction of the same into Victoria.

The case was tried before a jury upon the issue whether Hongkong, the last port the steamer left in China, was or not “an infected locality.” To prove that Hongkong was such, Dr. Davie was placed in the witness box as an expert. He considered “China the home of small pox,” and that it was “an infected place”; that, in China, small pox was “endemic,” i.e., always there; because there “inoculation” was the universal practice and was a constant source of danger; that in England and Europe and America, generally, vaccination, of late years, has been the rule. That was a preventative, and persons from such places were naturally not so much the object of suspicion or inspection to a health officer. He thought that too close a scrutiny could not be made of Chinese passengers. That small pox must have been in China on the 19th April last, the date when the Empress left Hongkong, as it was always there. He had no opinion to express as to the British possession of Hongkong; but it was a portion of China, where small pox was always, in a sense, ""endemic."" There was danger of infection from white passengers, but not the same danger as from Chinamen. It was his opinion that every one should be examined who comes from China or from any ""infected port.""

They should be examined on the ship. When asked the question, ""Would you allow Chinamen to land and go into the city?"" the Doctor replied, ""The whole of the baggage should be disinfected, on the steamer if possible—if not, on the Outer Wharf. If I could not do anything else I would take them out to the suspect station. I would, if I could,"" he continued, ""examine every passenger from there at the Outer Wharf. To do this it requires certain facilities which are wanting at the Outer Wharf."" The duty of the Health Officer, as Dr. Davie understood it, was to interview the ship's officers and ascertain the sanitary state of the ship during the voyage; to inspect the whole of the men, inspect every individual, before he left the vessel. He was of Judgment opinion that the whole of those landed should be disinfected. The Chinese are chiefly dressed in woollen materials and these harbour infection for weeks and months. The period of incubation of small pox was from twelve to fifteen days. Cases of small pox were found in all large seaport towns, as for instance Liverpool; but these were not ""endemic.""

If the vessel left Honkong, it was quite possible some cases might develop during the passage. If they were not examined on the steamer there were no facilities for doing so on the wharf. There were several other diseases to be guarded against from China, e.g., cholera, leprosy, etc. (Here I observe that from first to last no mention was made of the black plague, which has carried off so many thousands of Chinese in Hongkong; and it appeared that during the passage from China to Victoria, which presumably lasted over the ordinary period of inoculation, no case of small pox appeared on board the Empress, and that she showed a clean bill of health.)

1894. Upon the question whether or not Hongkong, at the time the steamer left on April 19, 1894, was or not ""an infected port,"" in the sense of Sec. 35, a place ""infected by a malignant, pestilential or infectious disease,"" and they were so charged. The jury returned the following verdict:—

""According to the evidence we find that on 1st May, 1894, Hongkong was an infected port. We speak according to the evidence of Dr. Davie, that the port of Hongkong was and is an infected port."" Now this assumes, as Dr. Davie assumed, that Hongkong, although a British port and subject to quarantine regulations, was (which includes the time of the steamer's departure) and is a cradle of small pox, and that every ship coming thence to Victoria, especially with Chinese on board, should be subject to the most searching examination, and the drastic treatment I have described. He does not include Japanese in the same category as Chinese. It was apparent throughout the Judgment. Doctor's evidence that he regarded the whole subject exclusively from a medical point of view, which is by no means identical with the legal construction which must prevail. The law, while it imposes on the Medical Health Officer the duty and arms him with abundant authority to deal imperatively almost in every case, at the same time insists that he shall discharge that duty with judgment and discretion, and not overrun the mark.

In this case, to say the least, he has not discharged his duty discreetly, but, on the contrary, has exceeded it. The whole gist of the by-law is to guard the case of persons ""infected or exposed to infection,"" words which have a definite legal meaning, which applies to persons who have been brought into actual contact with or within the baleful influence of an infectious or contagious disease, as travelling in the same carriage or boat with anyone affected by the disease, and not securely isolated from accidental or other contact, or has recently come from a locality where from an accumulation of cases or other reason the disease has got into the air and become epidemic.

This construction applies to Sections 12, 13, 15, 16 and 29 of the by-law by the wording of which this meaning is distinctly brought out.

His duty was, if he considered the Empress of China came from ""an infected locality,"" at once to go on board the suspected vessel and make his examination and inspection on board the vessel (as Section 32 says), ""before any luggage, freight or other thing is landed or allowed to be landed.""

It goes further and shews that the only person to be ""dealt with in such manner as the Medical Health City Officer shall direct"" is ""any infected or exposed person from on board,"" under none of which categories do the plaintiff or other Chinamen, seized and carted off on this occasion, happen to come.

There was not an atom of actual proof before the jury of Judgment. the actual existence of a single case of small pox in Hong-kong in April or May or since, beyond a medical opinion that there might be.

Now a medical opinion, however valuable as an opinion, is not the legal proof of a fact. It would be a painful surprise to the people of Hongkong and its business men, living under British rule, to learn that, on the strength only of the opinion of a learned expert, their place is given out to the world as an infected place, which the by-law interprets to mean a place ""infected with a malignant, pestilential or infectious disease,"" without any actual proof of the fact. In this case the plaintiff had been already duly and personally examined by Dr. McNaughton Jones, the able and experienced Health Officer, on his arrival, and passed. He had also been examined and passed by the Customs House officers as a man who had paid all his customs dues and had a certificate to shew the fact, which left him free to come and go as he pleased. It is not shewn that Dr.Duncan went on board, or that he conferred with the Dominion Health Officers as to whether any further examination of the plaintiff was necessary, or, in the public interest, advisable. It is shewn that he did not personally examine a single Chinaman or inquire if he was “an infected or exposed person.” In a matter affecting the public health, it is quite natural, and everyone would expect that officers who are armed with extensive sanitary powers, should confer together and assist one another in carrying out the law, and work well together for the public good and safety. Where that is not done the public are quick to note and comment on the fact.

The by-law is very properly arbitrary in its provisions and the powers it confers in cases of emergency, or even actual suspicion, on the Health Officer and his subordinates and these should be supported wherever practicable and the occasion warrants their employment.

But it should be understood that these exceptional powers are a great trust placed in the hands of the Health Officer to meet such cases as I have described, and at all times to be administered with firmness, judgment and discretion—not under any fear of infection unwarranted by the facts of the case which may enter into the mind of the Health Officer, or to be carried out by carting off en masse to the suspect station all who hail from China or Hongkong without examination or enquiry. The evidence shews there was nothing like emergency in the present case or anything to warrant the treatment they received.

On a review of the facts I am of opinion that the defendant exceeded his authority and caused the plaintiff great unnecessary loss and annoyance. I therefore give judgment for plaintiff against the defendant, but, as it is a test case, with only $5 damages and costs to be taxed.

REGINA v. MEE WAH. BEGBIE, C.J.

Constitutional law-B.N.A. Act, Sec. 92, s.s. 9-Taration-Municipal license fees-Direct or indirect tax-Construction of statute-Words ejusdem generis.

The Municipal Act, 1885, Sec. 10, extended the powers of municipalities so as to include "" licensing and regulating wash-houses and laundries,"" and Sec. 11 enacts that Municipalities may "" hereafter levy and collect from every person who keeps or carries on a public washhouse or laundry, such sum as shall be fixed on by by-law, not exceeding $75.00 for every 6 months.""

On appeal from a conviction for carrying on a public laundry without a license.

Held, (1) Taxation by means of license fees, and the tax in question, is indirect and not direct taxation.

(2) All indirect taxation, except that authorized by Sec. 92, s.s. 9. B.N.A. Act, providing ""in each province the legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to (9) shop, tavern, saloon, auctioneer and other licenses in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial, local or municipal purposes "" is ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature.

(3) The words ""and other licenses"" only included industries ejusdem generis with those specified, and do not include a wash-house.

(4) The most reasonable rule to adopt to ascertain whether a certain matter or thing is within the meaning of a statute as being ejusdem generis with things specified therein ""and others,"" is to look to the object or mischief aimed at by the statute. All similar things that come within that object, though not in the abstract ejusdem generis are so for the purposes of the statute.

(5) If it appears that a tax is not bona fide within the purpose provided for, but is imposed with the real purpose of discriminating against a class, it is not within the justification of the enabling statute, and, on the facts, the tax in question was intended not for the purpose of raising a revenue, but as a restriction on the Chinese.

APPEAL from a conviction for carrying on a public laundry without a license and payment of the license fee under a by-law of the Corporation of the City of Victoria based on Sec. 11 of Municipal Amendment Act, 1885.

The facts and arguments of counsel fully appear from the judgment.

A. N. Richards, Q.C., for the appeal.

J. S. Yates, contra.

BEGBIE, C.J .: This is an appeal from a conviction for carrying on a public laundry without a license and payment of the license fee under a recent by-law. It was not denied by the appellant that the by-law is authorized by the recent Provincial Act, the only question is whether that Provincial Act, viz .: clause 11 of the Municipal Amendment Act, 1885, is constitutional within the meaning of the British North America Act. Section 10 of the Provincial Act extends the powers of the Corporation so as expressly to include ""licensing and regulating wash-houses and laundries,"" and Section 11, referring to the existing expressed powers of Corporations to issue other licenses and collect fees or taxes in respect thereof, expressly adds this, that they may hereafter levy and collect "" from every person who keeps or carries on a public wash-house or laundry such sum as shall be fixed by by-law not exceeding $75.00 for every 6 months."" This is the clause impugned.

The clause in the B.N.A. Act upon which alone this Section of the Provincial Act is based is Section 92. "" In each province the Legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to * * * (sub-section 9) shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer and other licenses in order to the raising of a revenue for Provincial, local or Municipal purposes. Sub-section 16. ""Generally all matters of a merely local or private nature in the Province "" does not, I think, apply to taxation.

The only other sub-section which confers on the Provincial Legislature any power to tax is sub-section 2 which deals with direct taxation within the Province in order "" to the raising of a revenue for Provincial purposes."" But neither can this sub-section have any application here. 1st. It deals only with direct taxes and this taxation by means of license fee is indirect, not direct taxation. Severn's case, 2 S.C. Can. R. pp. 70, 90, 92, 113, 123, 137. 2nd. It deals only with taxation within, i.e. generally, throughout the ProvBEGBIE, C.J. ince, and these laundry license fees are only to be levied  within Municipalities, and may vary in different parts of 1886. Feb. 3. the Province. 3rd. It only authorizes taxes for Provincial revenue and these license fees are to fall into the MuniciREGINA 0. MEE WAH pal revenue. The consideration of sub-section 2, therefore, merely emphasizes the proposition (according to the Attorney-General of Quebec v. The Queen Assurance Company, 3 L.R. App. Cas. 1090) that all indirect taxation for Municipal purposes except what is authorized by sub-section 9 is illegal.

The first objection taken by Mr. Richards (viz.) that the clause is unconstitutional merely and broadly because it imposes an indirect tax seems to be too general. Such taxation will be valid enough, if the enactment comes fairly within the meaning of sub-section 9, nor can the next objection be fatal (viz.) the objection merely and broadly that it is in restraint of trade. Whether washing be a trade or a mere industry will presently be considered. UnquesJudgment. tionably all taxation on buying and selling, all interference with labour, may and perhaps must to some extent restrain trade, yet some instances of taxation of trades, and some regulations of labour, are undoubtedly within the power of the Provincial Legislature. Besides, this enactment, and . consequent by-law, do not absolutely restrain, i.e. forbid this industry. The laundryman may remove beyond the city limits and quite evade the tax.

Setting aside therefore these broad objections to the tax, as too general, the questions are two, (viz.)

1st. Does this license come within the words ""shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer and other license?"" and,

2nd. Is the tax imposed in order to raise a Municipal revenue, or is it imposed for any other purpose ? e.g. for restriction or suppression, total or partial.

The answer to the first question depends on the force of the words ""other licenses."" Whether that means other licenses on matters of the same kind as the four enumerated, according to the general rule of construction, or whether it means licenses for the doing or permitting any other thing whatever. It is said by a learned text writer, Sir P. Maxwell on Statutes, p. 303, that the rule restraining the generality of the word "" other "" to matters ejusdem generis only applies where the things actually named are themselves all of the same nature; but that where the things named are of different natures then the phrase "" other things or articles"" will extend to all objects, though quite different from those named. Citing for this among other cases Regina v. Payne 1 C.C.R. 27. There a statute made it penal to convey to a prisoner, in order to facilitate his escape, "" any mask, disguise, letter or other article or thing;"" and it was held that a crowbar was within the Act. So in Young v. Grattridge, 4 L.R.Q.B. 166, a Health Act empowered a medical officer to enter and inspect "" any slaughter-house, shop, building, market or other place "" and it was held that a butcher's yard which contained slaughtered cattle was within the Statute, Regina v. Edmundson, 2 E. & E. 77, is to a similar effect. But these decisions do not for their support apparently require the principle enunciated by Maxwell, nor was any such principle alluded to in any of them. And though his statement deserves great respect being cited approvingly by a very learned Judge in Severn's case, yet it was not followed by the other four Judges, nor does it appear to be founded on any other judicial dictum. And indeed it is submitted that such a construction of the doctrine of ejusdem generis is in some sense self-destructive.

If the two or more things actually named are identical as "" air, atmosphere, or other gas;"" "" dagger, poniard or other weapon,"" then the word "" other "" is to be confined to other gases strictly of the same nature, it does not extend the phrase at all and if the two things named are not identical as "" oil, vinegar or other fluids,"" the word "" other "" would extend to all other fluids whatever. The doctrine of ejusdem generis which has occupied many Courts and many BEGBIE, C.J. judgments and which therefore does really exist, would run  the risk of being annihilated. A more reasonable rule 1886. Feb. 3. REGINA MEE WAH would seem to be to look at the object or the mischief aimed at by the Statute or other instrument; all matters that come within that are ejusdem generis so far as the Statute is concerned. Thus in Gayne's case, a crow bar and a letter and a mask are no doubt extremely different in texture, weight and appearance. No painter or chemist would call them ejusdem generis; but they are all strictly ejusdem generis so far as that they are instruments calculated to facilitate a prisoner's escape. So in Young's case, a butcher's yard is strictly ejusdem generis with his shop and his slaughter house so far as regards the mischief of preparing unwholesome food. But a watchmaker's or a tailor's shop would not be ejusdem generis with a butcher's shop, though all are called shops; and meat in a tailor's shop would probably not have been liable to be seized under Statute in that instance.

If there were no matters or occupations having any analogy or attribute (except taxability) common to these four named instances in sub-section 9, the inference would be very strong that "" other licenses "" extended to every possible matter. But as was pointed out by Mr. Justice WILSON in Regina v. Taylor, 36 U.C.Q.B. 183, cited and approved in Severn v. Reginam, there are many analogous matters.

Restaurants and lodging houses bear no distant resemblance to taverns; coffee shops to saloons (though these again are utterly distinct from a teetotaler's point of view) and there are coupled together in the Insolvency Act, Canada, 1875, Sec. 1, brokers and commission agents to auctioneers, etc.

There are two classes of Statutes in which words are always strictly construed in favour of the party charged, even at the suit of the Crown; Statutes which create offences and Statutes which impose taxation.

The present Municipal Amendment Act, 1885, partakes of both natures, and the ordinary rule must I think be observed, viz., the subjects of the ""other licenses "" mentioned in sub-section 9 must have at least somewhat besides taxability (from which quality no Act or thing is exempt) in common with ""shops, taverns, saloons or auctioneers.""

Again suppose some other licenses, well known elsewhere, taxes as in England on man-servants, on hair powder, on armourial bearings-would these be authorized by subsection 9? I think not. Indeed if no restriction whatever be placed on the word "" other"" in that section; if the Provincial Legislature can insist upon imposing licenses upon everything and upon every act of life, and tax each licensee at any moment they please, there would be a very simple way of excluding every Chinaman from the Province, by imposing a universal tax, not limited to any nationality, of one or two thousand dollars per annum for a license to Judgment. wear long hair on the back of the head: or to exclude Russians by a license to wear a beard, or Jews by a license to eat unleavened bread. No Chinaman will shave the back of his head; no true moujik will shave his chin. There might be a tax on a license to register lands above a certain value; and we might have a graduated property tax. The opinion, therefore, of the majority of the Judges in Severn's case, seems more probable. There must I think be some limitation placed on the licensing power by the word "" other.""

Mr. Yates argued from even that point of view these laundries were taxable, for that the laundry men though they were very certainly not keeping shops, were very analogus to auctioneers. I rather think that the auctioneers would repudiate this alleged similarity of their occupation to that of a Chinese washerman. I cannot perceive it. An auctioneer has very extensive authority and important duties; he prepares advertisements and surveys, disposes property in lots, advises as to prices, and generally is the agent of both parties to the contract of sale. There is nothing of all BEGBIE. C.J. this in a laundry; and I feel strongly inclined to think that  laundries are not taxable under this sub-section at all, bearing no analogy to either ""shops, saloons, taverns or auctioneers.""

But without deciding on this ground there is a still more serious obstacle against supporting this clause 11 of the Provincial Act of 1885, as being within Section 92, subseetion 9. The taxation by way of license authorized by that sub-section 9 is to be ""in order to the raising a revenue for Provincial, local or Municipal purposes."" Now, licences may have for their object the raising of a revenue, or the regulation of a trade or occupation, or they may be imposed for the purpose of repression or suppression. And whatever power the Provincial Legislature may possess for regulation or repression; taxation for these two latter purposes is not authorized by the B.N.A. Act, but only taxation for the purpose of revenue. And it is roundly alleged by the appellant that this tax is imposed, not with the object of raising a revenue for the City, but with the object of harassing Chinamen, supposed to be the only persons carrying on this industry.

In considering this objection, we must distinguish between the real objects and the actual results of legislation. It is true the real object is very often, perhaps in most cases, shown by the result. But an Act which has bona fide only one object, may indirectly work out an entirely collateral result. An Act intended purely for a revenue, or regulation may greatly harass some particular individuals or classes of individuals; e.g. the Excise Acts. But the harassing of brewers is not the object of the Excise Acts. So on the other hand an Act intended purely for harassing of some one or more individuals may incidentally bring money into the City treasury. That incidental result will not validate the Statute, if the real object be unlawful. The objection to apply at all, must depend on the object, declared or dissembled, and not merely on the result or one  of the results of the provisions of the Act.

1886. If the object of the Provincial Statute be as alleged, viz., Feb. 3.  to subject Chinamen to exceptional disadvantages it is clearly unconstitutional. That point has been so held in this Court by Mr. Justice GRAY in Tai Lung's case, reported appx. G. to the report of the recent Chinese Conmission, p. 379, and by Mr. Justice CREASE in Wing Chong's case, 1 B.C.R. Pt. II, 150, both these learned Judges fortifying their opinions by numerous decisions and arguments of Judges in the United States' Courts. Those decisions are not binding on us here; and indeed are partly founded on the Constitution of the United States and its relation to the several States, which in many respects differ from the Constitution and the relation between the Dominion and the Provinces. But the Judges in those foreign Courts have had a much longer and more varied experience on these topics than ourselves; their institutions are closely analogous in many Judgment. respects, though, it is true, contrasted in others to our own. And their opinions and reasonings being also founded on international law, and, I take the liberty of saying, on natural equity and common sense, they are entitled to great weight beyond the limits of their own jurisdiction. I shall only mention Lee Sing v. Washburn, 20 Cal. Rep. 354; Baker v. Portland, 5 Law 750; Teburcio Parrott's case, coram SAWYER and HOFFMAN, J.J., 1880, and the Quene ordinance case, coram FIELD and SAWYER, J.J., 1879; the two latter cases published in a separate pamphlet form, in which the opinions of Mr. Justices FIELD, HOFFMAN, SAWYER and DEADY and other Judges whom they cite, all confirm this, that a State, or Provincial law imposing special disabilities or unequal burdens on Chinamen is unconstitutional and void. In British Columbia such a law if it impose a tax labours under the additional infirmity that a licence tax for any other purpose with any other object, than merely raising a revenue, is beyond the power of the Provincial Legislature to impose.

Mr. Yates, for the Corporation, urged that this Statute is  very different from the Statutes condemned by Mr. Justice 1886. Feb. 3. CREASE in Wing Chong's case and by Mr. GRAY in Tai Lung's case; those. Statutes were by their title and preamble  expressly aimed at Chinamen by name; that this distinction also renders inapplicable all the United States' cases cited; that this enactment is quite general extending to all laundries without exception and we must not look beyond the words of the enactment to enquire what its object was; that there is in fact one laundry in Victoria not conducted by Chinamen on which the tax will fall with equal force so that it is impossible to say that Chinamen are hereby exclusively selected for taxation; the circumstance that they are chiefly affected being a mere coincidence; that the bylaw only imposes $100.00 per annum, keeping far within the limit of $150.00 permitted by the Statute; that the tax clearly is calculated to procuring additional Municipal revenue and that no other object is hinted at.

Now it is true that this Statute does not, like those dealt with by Mr. Justice GRAY and Mr. Justice. CREASE by its Judgment. very title bind illegality upon its forehead; nor is there here any preamble like that in Wing Chong's case which Mr. Justice CREASE treats as "" without example,"" but which may well deserve the stern reproof uttered by Mr. Justice FIELD upon a somewhat similar enactment in California. "" It is not creditable to the humanity and civilization of our people, much less to their Christianity, that an ordinance of this character was possible."" Quene ordinance case, p. 9.

The recent statute has nothing of that sort. But it is very justly insisted upon by every Judge that the object of a statute is after all to be determined by the effect of its operative part. The title and preamble may be very objectionable, but if the operative sections are within the power of the Legislature they shall stand. On the other hand, the preamble may breathe the spirit of the purest and most  universal philanthropy, and the most submissive legality ;

1886. but that will not save any clauses which are otherwise Feb. 3. unconstitutional. And in determining the quality of any  clauses, the same Mr. Justice FIELD remarks : "" When we take our seats on the Bench, we are not struck with blindness and forbidden to know as Judges what we see as men ; and when an ordinance, though general in its terms, only operates upon a special race, sect or class, it being universally understood that it is to be enforced only against that race, sect or class, we may justly conclude that it was the intention of the body adopting it that it should only have such operation, and treat it accordingly."" Now can anybody in the Province, on or off the Bench, conscientiously say that this ordinance does not come within the principle thus enunciated ? I, for my part, cannot arrive at any other conclusion than that it is specially directed against Chinamen because they are Chinamen and for no other Judgment. reason ; to compel them to remove certain industries from the city or themselves from the Province. But the authorities already cited show that this effect cannot be attained directly, and what cannot be done directly will not be permitted to be done by a side wind. Tiburcio Parrott's Case, pp. 1634; Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall 325. "" If we hold otherwise,"" said the learned Judge, in that case ""no kind of oppression can be named against which the framers of (the B.N.A. Act) intended to guard which may not be effected.""

The appellants' contention that the clause is merely intended to hamper or expel Chinamen is much strengthened by considering the amount of the tax sanctioned, which is $150.00 per annum, whereas the limit sanctioned by the Legislature in the case of any retail shop, however extensive or lucrative its business, is only $10.00 per annum. In other words, this menial and poorly paid occupation may be taxed fifteen times the annual amount which the statute permits to be imposed on the most extensive grocery or dry goods store. It is impossible for me to believe that the BEGBIE, C.J, sole object or the main object of such an imposition is to aid the revenue of the Corporation.

The test is whether on the whole statute the Legislature can fairly be held to have said : ""Let us impose a tax in order to raise a revenue, though perhaps it may fall on Chinamen,"" or "" let us impose this tax in order to fall on Chinamen, though perhaps it will raise no revenue."" When we find (1st) no other description of labour taxed at all ; (2nd) this description of labour practically quite abandoned to Chinamen alone ; (3rd) this description of labour taxed at fifteen times the rate permitted to be levied on any retail shop ; (4th) that a preliminary Provincial Act has declared Chinamen incapable of the franchise which they formerly exercised. I cannot doubt but that the tax is directed against Chinamen, as such.

But the enormously disproportioned rate of taxation has another consequence. It shows that revenue was not the sole object of the tax ; probably not the object at all. If the promoters of this clause had been really casting about for Judgment. additional revenue, they must have seen that shops are a great deal more numerous than laundries and generally more remunerative.

It requires very little financial ability to perceive that a a small addition of $5.00 or $10.00 on shops would enrich the city far more than $150.00 per annum on every laundry, even if this last amount could be collected. But here the magnitude of the tax would entirely defeat the professed object and support the view that the concealed object was the true one. The occupation of a washerman is very poorly paid ; probably at a lower rate than any other trade or occupation, since in former years men of all nationalities busied themselves with this, which they have wholly abandoned, presumably for more lucrative employment ; whereas the number of shops, &c., has very much increased. It must have been apparent on the commonest reflection that this, the most poorly paid occupation, cannot endure fifteen times the tax imposed on the most lucrative; that such a 1886. tax would probably extinguish every laundry in Victoria ; Feb. 3. and so that no additional revenue would be produced at all. I cannot imagine that any person reading the clause would be blind to this; and I am compelled to think that restriction and not revenue was the very object of the tax. But it is clear that the Provincial Legistature has under the B.N.A. Act no power to impose or authorize a tax for the purpose of driving any industry out of the city or the Province.

Clanse 11 in the Act of 1883 seems, therefore, quite ultra vires and unconstitutional; and the by-law, which I have taken to be admitted as otherwise accurate, stands upon that clause alone and must fall with it. In fact, if the bylaw only imposes a moderate and reasonable amount, say $5.00 or $10.00 per annum, it would probably be equally a nullity. Even a reasonable and useful by-law cannot stand Judgment. if authorized only by an unconstitutional statute.

The general conclusions arrived at are these: (1.) It seems probable that laundries are not taxable within Subsection 9 of Section 92 B.N.A. Act. (2.) Any clause in a Provincial Statute or Municipal By-Law, which, though general in its terms, operates, or is intended to operate only upon one sect, race or class, is liable to be declared unconstitutional and void. (3.) The object of a statute is to be ascertained not only from its title or preamble, but mainly from its enactments. (4.) That a by-law, even if founded upon a valid statute must be reasonable, i.e., not necessarily equal but proportionate, and not such as to defeat the object of the law. This is all in conformity with the previous decisions of Mr. Justice CREASE in Wing Chong's Case and Mr. Justice GRAY in Tai Lung's Case, which are approved and followed.

In this case I am moreover of opinion (5th) that the Provincial Legislature has no power to impose or authorize any

license tax except for the bona fide object of raising revenue by the produce of the tax ; and that this Clause 11 was not enacted bona fide for that sole purpose or even mainly for 1886. that purpose, and is therefore unconstitutional and void. 

The conviction will, therefore, be set aside with costs. Appeal allowed. ",0

Application for a mandamus to the Corporation of the City of Victoria to compel the renewal to the prosecutors (Chinamen) of a pawnbroker's license.

Fell for the application ; Taylor for the Corporation.

SIR M. B. BEGBIE, C. J. :-

This is an application for a mandamus to the Corporation of the City of Victoria, ordering them to issue a renewal of a pawnbroker's license to the prosecutors. The reason alleged by the Corporation for their refusal is that they have passed a resolution stating that in their opinion the prosecutors are not fit persons to be the recipients of such a license. It is alleged by the prosecution, and not denied, that the Council have in fact ordered the Collector to issue no pawnbroking license to any Chinaman. And the proposition was broadly advanced before me that the Provincial Legislature have the right to eliminate nationalities or individuals from the capacity to receive these trade licenses : and that they have, in conformity with Regina v. Hodge, delegated to the Council authority to exercise that right. The first of these contentions has already been before this Court, and has, I think, been entirely denied by several Judges now on the bench. In the first place by Mr. Justice Gray, in Tai Sing v. Macguire (1 B.C.R. pt. i. 101, 1878): by Mr. Justice Crease in Wing Fong's case (1 B.C.R. pt. ii. 150, 1885); and by myself in Mee Wall's case (not reported). These decisions have never been appealed, and I do not feel at liberty to disregard them. I must, therefore, assume that no such authority exists in the Provincial Legislature, and therefore it is impossible that they could have delegated it, or conferred it on the Council. Evidently, if such a power existed, then, since no man may in any municipality pursue any avocation without such license, the Local Legislature might exclude large classes of men from gaining a livelihood, or indeed existing in the Province-a very wide interference with ""trade and commerce,"" which is totally removed from their control by the B. N. A. Act.

It may be useful, however, to examine briefly the grounds on which the Council have been advised that they have a discretion in the matter. This was, in the argument before me, entirely based on the permissive form adopted in the Statute (""Municipal Act, 1887,"" c. 16, s. 104). "" The municipality shall have power to issue licenses "" for the trades and professions enumerated, including pawnbrokers (sub-s. 10), ""and to levy and collect by means of such licenses the amounts"" therein specified. And stress was laid on the word "" license,"" as intimating a permission ; without which antecedent license or permission the proposing trader could not lawfully commence business (ss. 112, 113). But these words do not imply any discretion, i. e., authority to grant or refuse. Prima facie, every person living under the protection of British law has a right at once to exercise his industry and ability in any trade or calling he may select. The only instances in which some antecedent certificate of fitness or qualification is required are, I think, liquor dealers, medical men, and barristers and solicitors. These also have to take out annual licenses under the Municipality Act. But special tribunals are appointed to judge antecedently of their fitness. And, I think, it is quite unheard of that the Council should arbitrarily assume to refuse a license to any of these classes, or to volunteer any statement of their opinion of the fitness or unfitness of a doctor or solicitor. If the Council is to have an absolute discretion to refuse a license to any person applying, on the ground of what they choose to allege as unfitness, then half a dozen tradesmen may secure themselves an entire monopoly of their respective trades throughout the municipality, by simply voting that in their opinion each proposing competitor is an unfit person.

But if the least attention be bestowed on the Statute, it will be seen that the Legislature has given no discretion to the Council. The Statute does not even say they may ""grant "" licenses ; but only that they may issue them. The industrial classes are told, "" You may not carry on your trade in the municipality without a license; if you ask where to get a license, we have authorized the municipality to issue it on payment to them of the annual amount fixed by by-law."" Now, enabling words are always compulsory when they are words to effectuate a legal right (Julius v. Bp. Oxford, 5 App. Ca., L. R. 214). And it is of course unnecessary to prove-I should, but for this class of cases, have supposed that it was unnecessary even to state-the undoubted right, which is the boast of English law, that every person living under it has a right to his industry, and to the fruits of it. And when we look to the form of the license in the schedule to the Act we see that it is not issued by the corporation at all (which could only be done under seal), and that it amounts to nothing more than the collector's receipt for the license money, and a certificate that so far as that is concerned (and that is all that concerns the corporation) the holder may exercise the calling therein specified.

It was alleged that the occupation of a pawnbroker affords peculiar facilities for the concealment of stolen goods and the escape of criminals, and that it is particularly essential that care should be exercised

in the selection of persons to carry it on. It is, however, for the Legislature to speak on such a subject, and it has spoken. There are special laws relating to pawnbrokers. The business, it is true, is not, to most persons, attractive. A pawnbroker deals always with the needy, occasionally with the criminal classes: he must generally be hard, and always usurious. But he has always been considered a necessary evil. There has never, so far as I know, been placed any limit on their number, any more than on the number of bakers or butchers. It has been deemed sufficient to make special laws in respect to them and their books, and the supervision of the police. But so, also, are there many special laws for the inspection of butchers' shops under the Health Acts, and of grocers, and bakers, and milk dealers, and in fact of all traders, under the Weights and Measures Acts and the Adulteration Acts; and a reference to the London Police Courts will show that many classes of tradesmen far surpass the pawnbrokers in the number and importance of the charges against them before the stipendiary magistrates. In fact, the pawnbroker assists the detection of criminals perhaps as often as he defeats it, and is a most useful ally of the police.

It is not uninteresting to note the uniformity with which the same events result from the same principles, although in very different parts of the world. Victoria does not possess a monopoly of race jealousy. In the French colony of Cayenne, the Town Council recently handicapped the superior capacities of the Chinaman by imposing on merchants of that empire an extra tax of $300 per annum, deeming it also expedient to handicap English and German traders by a surtax of $200 on them. But on an appeal to the Courts at Paris, all these impositions were declared null on the very same principles as those on which the Courts here insisted when they decided the cases above referred to, viz., as being infringements at once of personal liberty, and of the equality of all men before the law, and also negation of international rights.

The prosecutors are entitled to their writ, and as the law on the subject has been quite clearly laid down ten years ago by Mr. Justice Gray, and again and again by other Judges, the defendants must pay all costs.

quong_wing_v_the_king.txt,Fitzpatrick,case,"QUONG WING v. THE KING. CAN.  

Supreme Court of Canada, Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, C.J., Davies, Idington, Duff, and Anglin, JJ. February 23, 1914. 1914  

FITZPATRICK, C.J:The appellant, a Chinaman and a naturalized Canadian citizen, was convicted of employing white female servants contrary to the provisions of chapter 17 of the statutes of Saskatchewan, 1912, and, for his defence, he contends that the Act in question is ultra vires of the provincial legislature.  

It is urged that the aim of the Act is to deprive the defendant and the Chinese generally, whether naturalized or not, of the rights ordinarily enjoyed by the other inhabitants of the Province of Saskatchewan and that the subject-matter of the Act is within the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.  

The Act in question reads as follows: 

1. No person shall employ in any capacity any white woman or girl or permit any white woman or girl to reside or lodge in or to work in or, save as a bona fide customer in a public apartment thereof only, to frequent any restaurant, laundry or other place of business or amusement owned, kept or managed by any Chinaman.  

2. Any employer guilty of any contravention or violation of this Act, shall, upon summary conviction be liable to a penalty not exceeding $100 and, in default of payment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two months.  

In terms the section purports merely to regulate places of business and resorts owned and managed by Chinese, independent of nationality, in the interest of the morals of women and girls in Saskatchewan. There are many factory Acts passed by provincial legislatures to fix the age of employment and to provide for proper accommodation for workmen and the conveni. ence of the sexes which are intended not only to safeguard the bodily health, but also the morals of Canadian workers, and I fail to understand the difference in principle between that legislation and this.  

It is also undoubted that the legislatures authorize the making by municipalities of disciplinary and police regulations to prevent disorders on Sundays and at night, and in that connection to compel tavern and saloon keepers to close their drinking places at certain hours. Why should those legislatures not have power to enact that women and girls should not be employed in certain industries or in certain places or by a certain class of people? This legislation may affect the civil rights of Chinamen, but it is primarily directed to the protection of children and girls.  

The Chinaman is not deprived of the right to employ others, but the classes from which he may select his employees are limited. In certain factories women or children under a certain age are not permitted to work at all, and, in others, they may not be employed except subject to certain restrictions in the interest of the employee's bodily and moral welfare. The difference between the restrictions imposed on all Canadians by such legislation and those resulting from the Act in question is one of degree, not of kind.  

I would dismiss the appeal with costs.  

DAVIES, J. : The question on this appeal is not one as to the policy or justice of the Act in question, but solely as to the power of the provincial legislature to pass it. There is no doubt that, as enacted, it seriously affects the civil rights of the Chinamen in Saskatchewan, 'whether they are aliens or naturalized British subjects. If the language of Lord Watson, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Union Colliery Company of British Columbia v. Bryden, [1899] A. C. 580, was to be accepted as the correct interpretation of the law defining the powers of the Dominion Parliament to legislate on the subject-matter of ""naturalization and aliens"" assigned to it by item 25 of section 91 of the British North America Act, 1867, I would feel some difficulty in upholding the legislation now under review. Lord Watson there said, at page 586 : 

But sec. 91, sub-sec. 25, might, possibly, be construed as conferring that power in case of naturalized aliens after naturalization. The subject of ""naturalization"" seems, prima facie, to include the power of enacting what shall be the consequences of naturalization, or, in other words, what shall be the rights and privileges pertaining to residents in Canada after they have been naturalized. It does not appear to their Lordships to be necessary, in the present case, to consider the precise meaning which the term ""naturalization"" was intended to bear, as it occurs in sec. 91, sub-sec. 25. But it seems clear that the expression ""aliens,"" occurring in that clause, refers to and, at least, includes all aliens who have not yet been naturalized; and the words ""no Chinaman,"" as they are used in section 4 of the provincial Act, were, probably, meant to denote, and they certainly include every adult Chinaman who has not been naturalized.

And, at page 587: But the leading feature of the enactments consists in this-that they have, and can have no application except to Chinamen who are aliens or naturalized subjects, and that they establish no rule or regulation except that these aliens or naturalized subjects shall not work, or be allowed to work, in underground coal mines within the Province of British Columbia.

Their Lordships see no reason to doubt that, by virtue of sec. 91, sub-sec. 25, the legislature of the Dominion is invested with exclusive authority in all matters which directly concern the rights, privileges and disabilities of the class of Chinamen who are resident in the provinces of Canada. They are also of opinion that the whole pith and substance of the enactments of section 4 of the Coal Mines Regulation Act, in so far as objected to by the appellant company, consists in establishing a statutory prohibition which affects aliens or naturalized subjects, and, therefore, trench upon the exclusive authority of the Parliament of Canada.

If the ""exclusive authority on all matters which directly concern the rights, privileges and disabilities of the class of Chinamen who are resident in the provinces of Canada"" is vested in the Dominion Parliament by sub-sec. 25 of sec. 91 of the B.N.A. Act, 1867, it would, to my mind, afford a strong argument that the legislation now in question should be held ultra vires.

But in the later case of Cunningham v. Tomey Homma, [1913] A.C. 151, the Judicial Committee modified the views of the construction of sub-sec. 25 of sec. 91 stated in the Union Colliery decision. Their Lordships say, at pages 156-157: Could it be suggested that the Province of British Columbia could not exclude an alien from the franchise in that province? Yet, if the mere mention of alienage in the enactment could make the law ultra vires, such a construction of sec. 91, sub-sec. 25, would involve that absurdity. The truth is that the language of that section does not purport to deal with the consequences of either alienage or naturalization. It, undoubtedly, reserves these subjects for the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion-that is to say, it is for the Dominion to determine what shall constitute either the one or the other, but the question as to what consequences shall follow from either is not touched. The right of protection and the obligations of allegiance are necessarily involved in the nationality conferred by naturalization; but the privileges attached to it, where these depend upon residence, are quite independent of nationality.

Reading the Union Colliery case, [1899] A.C. 580, therefore, as explained in this later case, and accepting their Lordships' interpretation of sub-sec. 25 of sec. 91, that ""its language does not purport to deal with the consequences of either alienage or naturalization,"" and that, while it exclusively reserves these subjects to the jurisdiction of the Dominion in so far as to determine what shall constitute either alienage or naturalization, it does not touch the question of what consequences shall follow from either, I am relieved from the difficulty I would otherwise feel.

The legislation under review does not, in this view, trespass upon the exclusive power of the Dominion legislature. It does deal with the subject-matter of ""property and civil rights"" within the province, exclusively assigned to the provincial legislatures, and so dealing cannot be held ultra vires, however harshly it may bear upon Chinamen, naturalized or not, residing in the province. There is no inherent right in any class of the community to employ women and children which the legislature may not modify or take away altogether. There is nothing in the British North America Act which says that such legislation may not be class legislation. Once it is decided that the subject-matter of the employment of white women is within the exclusive powers of the provincial legislature and does not infringe upon any of the enumerated subject-matters assigned to the Dominion, then such provincial powers are plenary.

What objects or motives may have controlled or induced the passage of the legislation in question I do not know. Once I find its subject-matter is not within the powers of the Dominion Parliament and is within that of the provincial legislature, I cannot inquire into its policy or justice or into the motives which prompted its passage. But, in the present case, I have no reason to conclude that the legislation is not such as may be defended upon the highest grounds. The regulations impeached in the Union Colliery case, DOMINION LAW REPORTS. [18 D.L.R. [1899] A.C. 580, were, as stated by the Judicial Committee, in the later case of Tomey Homma, [1903] A.C. 151, at p. 157 not really aimed at the regulation of coal mines at all, but were in truth devised to deprive the Chinese, naturalized or not, of the ordinary rights of the inhabitants of British Columbia and, in effect, to prohibit their continued residence in that province, since it prohibited their earning their living in that province. I think the pith and substance of the legislation now before us is entirely different. Its object and purpose is the protection of white women and girls; and the prohibition of their employment or residence, or lodging, or working, etc., in any place of business or amusement owned, kept or managed by any Chinaman is for the purpose of ensuring that protection. Such legislation does not, in my judgment, come within the class of legislation or regulation which the Judicial Committee held ultra vires of the provincial legislatures in the case of The Union Collieries v. Bryden, [1899] A.C. 580. The right to employ white women in any capacity or in any class of business is a civil right, and legislation upon that subject is clearly within the powers of the provincial legislatures. The right to guarantee and ensure their protection from a moral standpoint is, in my opinion, within such provincial powers and, if the legislation is bona fide for that purpose, it will be upheld even though it may operate prejudicially to one class or race of people. There is no doubt in my mind that the prohibition is a racial one and that it does not cease to operate because a Chinaman becomes naturalized. It extends and was intended to extend to all Chinamen as such, naturalized or aliens. Questions which might arise in cases of mixed blood do not arise here. The Chinaman prosecuted in this case was found to have been born in China and of Chinese parents and, although, at the date of the offence charged, he had become a naturalized British subject, and had changed his political allegiance, he had not ceased to be a ""Chinaman"" within the meaning of that word as used in the statute. This would accord with the interpretation of the word ""Chinaman"" adopted by the judicial committee in the case of The Union Colliery Company v. Bryden, [1899] A.C. 580. The prohibition against the employment of white women was not aimed at alien Chinamen simply or at Chinamen having any political affiliation. It was against ""any Chinaman"" whether owing allegiance to the rulers of the Chinese Empire, or the United States Republic, or the British Crown. In other words, it was not aimed at any class of Chinamen, or at the political status of Chinamen, but at Chinamen as men of a particular race or blood, and whether aliens or naturalized. For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs. 

IDINGTON, J. (dissenting) : The legislature of Saskatchewan, by ch. 17 of the statutes of 1912, intituled An Act to prevent the Employment of Female Labour in certain capacities enacted as follows :-

1. No person shall employ in any capacity any white woman or girl or permit any white woman or girl to reside or lodge in or to work in or, save as a bona fide customer in a public apartment thereof only, to frequent any restaurant, laundry or other place of business or amusement owned, kept or managed by any Japanese, Chinaman or other Oriental person ; 

which is followed by a penal clause under which appellant has been convicted. That conviction has been maintained by the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan in a judgment from which the learned Chief Justice of that Court dissented.

The first question raised is whether or not the appellant, who is admitted to have been born in China, of Chinese parents but was at the time of the alleged offence a naturalized British subject, falls within the Act. It is quite clear that the term ""any Chinaman"" may, in the plain, ordinary sense of the words, be so construed as to include naturalized British subjects. It is, to my mind, equally clear that, having regard to many considerations, to some of which I am about to advert, a proper and effective meaning may be given to this term without extending it to cover the naturalized British subject.

The Act, by its title, refers to female labour and then proceeds to deal with only the case of white women. In truth, its evident purpose is to curtail or restrict the rights of Chinamen. In view of the provisions of the Naturalization Act, under and pursuant to which the appellant, presumably, has become a naturalized British subject, one must have the gravest doubt if it ever was intended to apply such legislation to one so naturalized.

The Naturalization Act, in force long before and at the time of the creation of the Province of Saskatchewan, and ever since, provided by section 4 for aliens acquiring and holding real and personal property, and by sec. 24, as follows: 24. An alien to whom a certificate of naturalization is granted shall, within Canada, be entitled to all political and other rights, powers and privileges, and be subject to all obligations to which a natural-born British subject is entitled or subject within Canada, with this qualification, that he shall not, when within the limits of the foreign state of which he was a subject previously to obtaining his certificate of naturalization, be deemed to be a British subject unless he has ceased to be a subject of that state in pursuance of the laws thereof, or in pursuance of a treaty or convention to that effect.

These enactments rest upon the class No. 25 of the classification of subjects assigned, by sec. 91 of the British North America Act, 1867, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament, and which reads as follows: Naturalization and Aliens.

The political rights given any one, whether naturalized or natural-born British subjects, may in many respects be limited and varied by the legislation of a province, even if discriminating in favour of one section or class as against another. Some political rights or limitations thereof may be obviously beyond the power of such legislature. But the ""other rights, powers and privileges"" (if meaning anything) of natural-born British subjects to be shared by naturalized British subjects, do not so clearly fall within the powers of the legislatures to discriminate with regard to as between classes or sections of the community.

It may well be argued that the highly prized gifts of equal freedom and equal opportunity before the law, are so characteristic of the tendency of all British modes of thinking and acting in relation thereto, that they are not to be impaired by the whims of a legislature; and that equality taken away unless and until forfeited for causes which civilized men recognize as valid. For example, is it competent for a legislature to create a system of slavery and, above all, such a system as applied to naturalized British subjects? This legislation is but a piece of the product of the mode of thought that begot and maintained slavery; not so long ago fiercely claimed to be a laudable system of governing those incapable of governing themselves.

Again, it may also be well argued that, within the exclusive powers given to the Dominion Parliament over the subject of naturalization and aliens, there is implied the power to guarantee to all naturalized subjects that equality of freedom and opportunity to which I have adverted. And I ask, has it not done so by the foregoing provision of the Naturalization Act?

It is quite clear that, if the Dominion Government so desire, it can, by the use of the veto power given it over all local provincial legislation insist upon the preservation of this equality of freedom and opportunity.

It is equally clear that a casual consideration of this Saskatchewan Act might not arrest the attention of those whose duty it is to consider and determine whether or not any provincial Act should be vetoed. It might well be that, in regard to such an Act respecting aliens, those discharging the duty relative to the veto power might let it go for what it might be worth, knowing that, as to them, Parliament could later intervene; whereas other considerations might arise as to naturalized subjects and the duty to protect those naturalized be overlooked by reason of the general term used.  

It may be that the guarantee which I incline to think is implied in the Naturalization Act covers the ground. If so, there is then in this Act that which, as applied to the appellant (a naturalized subject) is ultra vires the legislature.  

If so, this conviction falls to the ground. Much stress is laid, on the one hand, upon the expression of opinion in the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of The Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden, [1899] A.C. 580, and, on the other hand, in that in the judgment of the same Court in the case of Cunningham v. Tomey Homma, [1903] A.C. 151.  

I may observe that a decision is only binding for that which is necessary to the decision of the case and add that, perhaps, neither expression of opinion now relied upon by the respective parties hereto was actually necessary for the determination of the case. Perhaps neither decision, in itself, can be said to be conclusive by way of governing the questions to be resolved herein. But of the two the former, certainly, so far as one can gather from the report, touches more nearly or directly the point involved in the present inquiry.  

Of course, such opinions, even if obiter dicta, are entitled to that weight to be given such eminent authority. What was clearly decided in the first case was that such comprehensive language as used in the regulation in question and, I rather think, aimed chiefly at alien Chinamen, was ultra vires, and, in the other, that the political right to vote was something within the express power of the legislature to give or withhold or restrict as it should see fit. This later point in no way touches what is raised herein.  

With the very greatest respect, I submit that the obiter dictum, relative to the limitations of the power existent in the Dominion Parliament by virtue of the assignment to it of paramount legislative authority over the subject of ""naturalization and aliens"" never was intended to be treated or taken in the sense now sought to be attributed to it, and, if bearing such implication, that it is not maintainable.  

Canada, for example, is deeply interested as a whole and always has been in the colonization of its waste lands by aliens expecting to become British subjects, and surely the power over naturalization must involve in its exercise many considerations relative to the future status of such people as invited to go there and accept the guarantees and inducements offered them. To define and forever determine beyond the power of any legislature to alter the status of such people and measure out their rights by that enjoyed by the native-born seems to me a power implied in the power over ""naturalization and aliens."" Many incidental powers have, as something implied in the other powers, contained in the same category, been held as attached thereto or to be used as part thereof with less excuse for the implication of incidental power there in question than would be involved in going a good deal further than I suggest in the execution of this power over ""naturalization and aliens"" the Dominion Parliament may go.

Some of these guarantees might depend on conventions with other powers, and I should hesitate to hamper the exercise of the power by any such limitations thereon as a provincial legislature might think fit to impose. That power must be treated as the other powers categorically assigned to Parliament by section 91 of the B.N.A. Act, 1867, in a wide and statesmanlike fashion. All these considerations have, in a measure, been observed in the provisions of the Naturalization Act, and in framing the provisions I have quoted and other like provisions. No one can, as of right, become naturalized. He must reside for three years in this country and thus become known to those who have to aid in his qualifying himself by shewing that he is of good character. Unless and until he fulfil these conditions he cannot come within the class to which appellant belongs.  

The appellant having, under the Naturalization Act (as I think fair to infer) become a British subject, he has presumably been certified to as a man of good character and enjoying the assurance, conveyed in section thereof which I have quoted, of equal treatment with other British subjects, I shall not willingly impute an intention to the legislature to violate that assurance by this legislation specially aimed at his fellow-countrymen in origin. Indeed, in a piece of legislation alleged to have been promoted in the interests of morality, it would seem a strange thing to find it founded upon a breach of good faith which lies at the root of nearly all morality worth bothering one's head about.  

Having regard to all the foregoing considerations and the further consideration that this is a penal statute and, therefore, to be read and construed according to the principle applicable to such like statutes, I think this is one of the relatively few instances in which we can depart from the cardinal rule of interpreting all documents, including statutes, according to the plain ordinary reading of the language used, and, with Bowen, L.J., in Wandsworth Board of Works v. United Telephone Co., 13 Q.B.D. 904, ask ourselves if these words so read are capable of two constructions and, if so, say :- 

It is wise to adopt such a construction as is based upon the assumption that Parliament merely intended to give so much power as was necessary for carrying out the objects of the Act, and not to give any unnecessary powers.  

Or say, with Keating, J., in Boon v. Howard (in 1874), L.R. 9 C.P. 277, at 308 : 

If the words are susceptible of a reasonable and also of an unreasonable construction, the former construction must prevail.  

Other like cases are collected in Hardcastle (3rd ed.), at 174 et seq.  

Looked at from this point of view I am constrained to think that this Act must be construed as applicable only to those Chinamen who have not become naturalized British subjects, and is not applicable to the appellant who has become such.  

Whether it is ultra vires or intra vires the alien Chinamen is a question with which, in this view, I have nothing to do.  

Yet, in deference to the argument put forward in way of so interpreting the British North America Act that the reservation to Parliament at the end of sec. 91 of the powers enumerated in said section 91 must apply only in its limitation to item number 16 of sec. 92, instead of as usually construed, so far as necessary to each and all of the enumerated powers given by that section, I may be permitted to say that I wholly dissent from the view put forward. I look upon the powers given Parliament in the twenty-nine enumerated classes set forth in sec. 91, so far as necessary to give efficacy thereto, as paramount to anything contained elsewhere as in sec. 92.  

Subject thereto, and some other special powers given Parliament, the powers given the legislatures are exclusive and cannot be infringed upon or restricted save by the veto power. There is, however, the possibility of legislation by a legislature being held good until Parliament asserts its powers in conflict therewith.  

Until this relation of the powers respectively given Parliament and the legislatures and their order of priority and superiority is thoroughly comprehended and acted upon, there is sure to be confusion in working the system and that confusion invites and induces still greater confusion when the place of the residual power has to be fixed and the relation thereof to these considered.

The maintenance of the warehouse receipts given banks by virtue of the Bank Act, as against local legislation resting upon authority over property and civil rights, as held in Tennant v. The Union Bank of Canada, [1894] A.C. 31, illustrates how unfounded is the argument put forward. And the case of the Grand Trunk Railway Company v. The Attorney-General of Canada, [1907] A.C. 65, relative to the power of a railway company to contract itself out of the provision of the Railway Act, prohibiting such a contract with its employees, is another illustration of how the law of a province, quite good till Parliament asserted its power, by virtue of sec. 91, sub-sec. 29, must bend before such assertion of superior power.  

The fact that Parliament has, in regard to naturalization, intervened, has much weight with me in reaching the conclusion I have as a reason why the legislature must not be presumed to have decided to ignore what is enacted by Parliament.  

I am by no means to be held as deciding the effect of that legislation by Parliament. All I say, in way of deciding herein, is that until, in such case, the legislature makes it clear that it intended to question the effect of that legislation, I need go no further than say it has not clearly expressed its intention to assert and exercise such a doubtful right.  

It is an attempt to cover and classify by an ambiguous term the case of a man who is in truth and fact what the term used clearly implies, and may return home any day, with that of a man who may have bid good-bye forever to his native land, induced to do so by the assurances offered him. I may add that we are not instructed as to the exact relation between China and Great Britain in regard to the position of the appellant, and, for the present purpose, that is immaterial, but I can conceive of further considerations of this sort of legislation rendering more full information necessary than this case does. And, if the like term ""Chinaman,"" as used here and in The Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden, [1899] A.C. 580, is to be read as extending to such, when naturalized British subjects, then the decision therein must bind us herein.  

I think, therefore, that this appeal should be allowed with costs.  

QUONG WING v. DUFF, J.: The first question to be considered is a question of jurisdiction which was raised during the course of the argument. The appeal comes before us by leave, under sec. 37 (c), Duff, J. but an order made under that provision does not conclude the question of jurisdiction which arises here. Sec. 36, sub-sec. ""b,"" provides in express terms that there shall be ""no appeal in a criminal case except as provided in the Criminal Code."" In the judgments of three members of the Court in Re McNutt, 47 Can. S.C.R. 259, 10 D.L.R. 834, 21 Can. Cr. Cas. 157, 49 C.L.J. 117, the word ""criminal,"" as it appears in sec. 39, sub-sec. ""c"" (and it is obviously used in the same sense in sub-sec. ""a,"" sec. 36) was construed in the broad sense as applying to proceedings for the punishment of offences under provincial penal enactments, which, if passed by a legislature exercising authority unrestricted as to subject-matter would, according to the general principles, be classified as criminal law. See pages 261, 267, and 286.  

If these views correctly interpret the word ""criminal"" in sec. 39(c), it would follow, I think, that the appeal in the present case comes within the prohibitions of sec. 36(b), and is incompetent.  

For reasons, however, which I gave in full, Re McNutt, 47 Can. S.C.R. 259, 10 D.L.R. 834, 21 Can. Cr. Cas. 157, 49 C.L.J. 117, I think the phrases ""criminal case"" and ""criminal charge"" in these provisions of the Supreme Court Act must be read in the narrow sense there indicated, and in my view the prohibitions contained in sub-sec. ""a"" and ""b,"" of sec. 36, have no application to judgments in proceedings under provincial penal statutes.  

The statute in question came into force on May 1, 1912, and is in the following words:  

No person shall employ in any capacity any white woman or girl or permit any white woman or girl to reside or lodge in or to work in or, save as a bona fide customer in a public apartment thereof only, to frequent any restaurant, laundry or other place of business or amusement owned, kept or managed by any Japanese, Chinaman or other Oriental person.

Any employer guilty of any contravention or violation of this Act shall, upon summary conviction, be liable to a penalty not exceeding $100 and, in default of payment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two months.  

This Act shall come into force on the first of May, 1912.  

On May 27, 1912, the appellant, who was a restaurant keeper, was convicted by the police magistrate of Moose Jaw of the offence of employing white female servants in contravention of the provisions of this Act. On January 11, 1913, the Act was amended by striking out the italicized words in the last two lines of sec. 1, its application being thereby limited to ""Chinamen.""  

The appellant, at the time of the alleged offence, had been naturalized under the naturalization laws of Canada.  

The first question for consideration, which is the substantial question on the appeal, is whether, assuming that this statute is not in conflict with any Act passed by the Parliament of Canada, it is within the scope of the legislative powers of the Province of Saskatchewan.  

It might plausibly be contended that it is legislation in relation to any one of these three classes of subjects: ""local undertakings,"" sec. 92 (B.N.A. Act), item 10, or ""property and civil rights"" within Saskatchewan, sec. 92(13), or ""matters merely local or private"" in Saskatchewan, sec. 92(16). For the purposes of this judgment it may be assumed that the words ""any. restaurant, laundry or other place of business or amusement"" are not in this enactment descriptive of ""local works or undertakings"" within the meaning of sec. 92(10); and I shall assume further that (although the legislation does unquestionably deal with civil rights) the real purpose of it is to abate or prevent a ""local evil"" and that considerations similar to those which influenced the minds of the Judicial Committee in The Attorney-General of Manitoba v. The Manitoba License-Holders' Association, [1902] A.C. 73, lead to the conclusion that the Act ought to be regarded as enacted under sec. 92(16), ""matters merely local or private within the province,"" rather than under sec. 92 (13), ""property and civil rights within the province."" There can be no doubt that, prima facie, legislation prohibiting the employment of specified classes of persons in particular occupations on grounds which touch the public health, the public morality or the public order from the ""local and provincial point of view"" may fall within the domain of the authority conferred upon the provinces by sec. 92(16).  

Such legislation stands upon precisely the same footing in relation to the respective powers of the provinces and of the Dominion as the legislation providing for the local prohibition of the sale of liquor, the validity of which legislation has been sustained by several well-known decisions of the Judicial Committee, including that already referred to.  

The enactment is not necessarily brought within the category of ""criminal law,"" as that phrase is used in sec. 91 of the B.N.A. Act, 1867, by the fact merely that it consists simply of a prohibition and of clauses prescribing penalties for the non-observance of the substantive provisions. The decisions in Hodge v. The Queen, 9 App. Cas. 117, and in the Attorney-General for Ontario v. The Attorney-General for the Dominion, [1896] A.C. 348, as well as in the Attorney-General of Manitoba v. The Manitoba License-Holders' Association, [1902] A.C. 73, already mentioned, established that the provinces may, under sec. 92 (16) of the B.N.A. Act, 1867, suppress a provincial evil by prohibiting simpliciter the doing of the acts which constitute the evil or the maintaining of conditions affording a favourable milieu for it, under the sanction of penalties authorized by sec. 92 (15).  

The authority of the legislature of Saskatchewan to enact this statute now before us is disputed upon the ground that the Act is really and truly legislation in relation to a matter which falls within the subject assigned exclusively to the Dominion by sec. 91(25), ""aliens and naturalization,"" and to which, therefore, the jurisdiction of the province does not extend. This is said to be shown by the decision of the Privy Council in The Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden, [1899] A.C. 580.  

I think that, on the proper construction of this Act (and this appears to me to be the decisive point), it applies to persons of the races mentioned without regard to nationality. According to the common understanding of the words ""Japanese, Chinaman or other Oriental person,"" they would embrace persons.

Prima facie, therefore, the Act is not an Act dealing with aliens or with naturalized subjects as such. It seems also impossible to say that the Act is, in its practical operation, limited to aliens and naturalized subjects. From the figures given by the census of 1911 it appears that, while the total Chinese population of the three western provinces was about 22,000, there were about 1,700 persons born in Canada classed as Chinese, nearly all of whom would be found in those provinces; and these, of course, are natural born subjects of His Majesty. There are at this moment in Western Canada, moreover, considerable numbers of people unquestionably embraced within the description ""Oriental persons"" who have come to this country from other parts of His Majesty's territorial dominions and as regards nationality stand in the same category. The Act would (giving its words their usual meaning) apply to all these; and there can be no sound reason for suggesting that they can, consistently with the objects of the enactment, be excluded from the field of its operation.

The appellant's attack is really based upon a certain interpretation of the decision of their Lordships by the Judicial Committee in The Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden, [1899] A.C. 580. Lord Watson, in delivering their Lordships' judgment, at p. 587, said:  ""But the leading feature of the enactments consists in this-that they have, and can have, no application except to Chinamen who are aliens or naturalized subjects, and that they establish no rule or regulation except that these aliens or naturalized subjects shall not work, or be allowed to work, in underground coal mines within the province of British Columbia. They are also of the opinion that the whole pith and substance of the enactments or section 4 of the Coal Mines Regulation Act, in so far as objected to by the appellant company, consists in establishing a statutory prohibition which affects aliens or naturalized subjects, and, therefore, trench upon the exclusive authority of the Parliament of Canada.""

Of the legislation before us it would be impossible to say that ""it has and can have no application except to 'Orientals' who are aliens or naturalized subjects,"" as I have already pointed out. It seems equally impossible to affirm that it establishes any rule or regulation at all comparable to regulations of the character described by His Lordship, viz., ""that these aliens or naturalized subjects shall not work or be allowed to work in certain industries,"" and, lastly, it would be going quite beyond what is warranted by anything like a fair reading of the statute before us to say of it that ""it establishes no rule or regulation laying a prohibition upon aliens or naturalized subjects.""

Orientals are not prohibited in terms from carrying on any establishment of the kind mentioned. Nor is there any ground for supposing that the effect of the prohibition created by the statute will be to prevent such persons carrying on any such business. It would require some evidence of it to convince me that the right and opportunity to employ white women is, in any business sense, a necessary condition for the effective carrying on by Orientals of restaurants and laundries and like establishments in the Western provinces of Canada. Neither is there any ground for supposing that this legislation is designed to deprive Orientals of the opportunity of gaining a livelihood.

otherwise answering the description who, as being born in British territory (Singapore, Hong Kong, Victoria or Vancouver, for instance), are natural born subjects of His Majesty equally with persons of other nationalities. The terms Chinaman and Chinese, as generally used in Canadian legislation, point to a classification based upon origin, upon racial or personal characteristics and habits, rather than upon nationality or allegiance. The Chinese Immigration Act, for example, R.S.C., 1906, ch. 95 (sec. 2 (d) and sec. 7), particularly illustrates this; and the judgment of Mr. Justice Martin, Re The Coal Mines Regulation Act, 10 B.C.R. 408, at pp. 421 and 428, gives other illustrations. Indeed, the presence of the phrase ""other Oriental persons"" seems to make it clear, even if there could otherwise have been any doubt upon the point, that the legislature is not dealing with these classes of persons according to nationality, but as persons of a certain origin or persons having certain common characteristics and habits sufficiently indicated by the language used.

There is nothing in the Act itself to indicate that the legislature is doing anything more than attempting to deal according to its lights (as it is its duty to do) with a strictly local situation. In the sparsely inhabited Western provinces of this country the presence of Orientals in comparatively considerable numbers not infrequently raises questions for public discussion and treatment, and, sometimes in an acute degree, which in more thickly populated countries would excite little or no general interest. One can without difficulty figure to one's self the considerations which may have influenced the Saskatchewan Legislature in dealing with the practice of white girls taking employment in such circumstances as are within the contemplation of this Act; considerations, for example, touching the interests of immigrant European women, and considerations touching the effect of such a practice upon the local relations between Europeans and Orientals; to say nothing of considerations affecting the administration of the law. And, in view of all this, I think, with great respect, it is quite impossible to apply with justice to this enactment the observation of Lord Watson in the Bryden case, [1899] A.C. 580, that ""the whole pith and substance of it is that it establishes a prohibition affecting"" Orientals. For these reasons, I think, apart altogether from the decision in Cunningham v. Tomey Homma, [1903] A.C. 151, to which I am about to refer, that the question of the legality of this statute is not ruled by the decision in Bryden's case.

I think, however, that in applying Bryden's case we are not entitled to pass over the authoritative interpretation of that decision which was pronounced some years later by the Judicial Committee itself in Cunningham v. Tomey Homma, [1903] A.C. 151. The legislation their Lordships had to examine in the last mentioned case, it is true, related to a different subject-matter. Their Lordships, however, put their decision upon grounds that appear to be strictly appropriate to the question raised on this appeal. Starting from the point that the enactment then in controversy was prima facie within the scope of the powers conferred by sec. 92(1), they proceeded to examine the question whether, according to the true construction of sec. 91 (25), the subject-matter of it really fell within the subject of ""aliens and naturalization""; and, in order to pass upon that point, their Lordships considered and expounded the meaning of that article.

At pp. 156 and 157, Lord Halsbury, delivering their Lordships' judgment, says:  If the mere mention of alienage in the enactment could make the law ultra vires, such a construction of section 91, sub-section 25, would involve that absurdity. The truth is that the language of that section does not purport to deal with the consequences of either alienage or naturalization. It undoubtedly reserves these subjects for the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion-that is to say, it is for the Dominion to determine what shall constitute either the one or the other, but the question as to what consequences shall follow either is not touched. The right of protection and the obligations of allegiance are necessarily involved in the nationality conferred by naturalization; but the privileges attached to it, where these depend upon residence, are quite independent of nationality.

It was hardly disputed that if this passage stood alone the argument of the appellant must fail. But it is said that this passage is obiter and is inconsistent with and, indeed, contradictory to certain passages in Lord Watson's judgment in Bryden's case, [1899] A.C. 580, which passages, it is contended, give the true ground of the decision in that case and, consequently, are binding upon us. I have already said what I have to say as to the effect of Lord Watson's judgment; but I think this last mentioned argument is completely answered by reference to a subsequent passage of Lord Halsbury's judgment in Cunningham's case, [1903] at p. 157. It is as follows: 

That case depended upon totally different grounds. This Board dealing with the particular facts of the case, came to the conclusion that the regulations there impeached were not really aimed at the regulation of coal mines at all, but were in truth devised to deprive the Chinese, naturalized or not, of the ordinary rights of the inhabitants of British Columbia and, in effect, to prohibit their continued residence in that province, since it prohibited their earning their living in that province.

That is an interpretation of Bryden's case, [1899] A.C. 580, which it appears to me to be our duty to accept.

It should not be forgotten that the very eminent Judges (Lord Halsbury, Lord Macnaghten, Lord Lindley), constituting the Board which heard the appeal in Cunningham's case, [1903] A.C. 151, had that case before them for something like six months after it had been very fully argued by Mr. Blake against the provincial view; and, in delivering the considered judgment of the Board, Lord Halsbury, as we have seen, examines and sums up the effect of the decision in Bryden's case, [1899] A,C. 580, which the Courts in British Columbia had believed themselves to be following in passing upon Cunningham's case, [1903] A.C. 151. In these circumstances, whatever might otherwise have been one's view of their Lordships' judgment in Bryden's case, [1899] A.C. 580, we should not be entitled to adopt and act upon a view as to the construction of item 25 of sec. 91 (B.N.A. Act), which was distinctly and categorically rejected in the later judgment.  

There is one more point to be noted. Section 24 of the Naturalization Act, ch. 77, of the R.S.C., 1906, provides as follows:  An alien to whom a certificate of naturalization is granted shall, within Canada, be entitled to all political and other rights, powers and privileges, and be subject to all obligations, to which a natural-born British subject is entitled or subject within Canada, with this qualification that he shall not, when within the limits of the foreign state of which he was a subject previously to obtaining his certificate of naturalization, be deemed to be a British subject, unless he has ceased to be a subject of that state in pursuance of the laws thereof, or in pursuance of a treaty or convention to that effect.  

It is unnecessary to consider whether or not this section goes beyond the powers of the Dominion in respect of the subject of naturalization, or whether ""the rights, powers and privileges"" referred to therein ought to be construed as meaning those only which are implied by the ""protection"" that is referred to as the correlative of allegiance in the passage above quoted from the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Cunningham's case, [1903] A.C. 151. This much seems clear: The section cannot fairly be construed as conferring upon persons naturalized under the provisions of the Naturalization Act, a status in which they are exempt from the operation of laws passed by a provincial legislature in relation to the subjects of sec. 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, and applying to native-born subjects of His Majesty in like manner as to naturalized subjects and aliens. If the enactment in question had been confined to Orientals who are native-born British subjects it would have been impossible to argue that there was any sort of invasion of the Dominion jurisdiction under sec. 91 (25); and it seems equally impossible to say that this legislation deprives any Oriental, who is a naturalized subject, of any of ""the rights, powers and privileges"" which an Oriental, who is a native-born British subject, is allowed to exercise or retain.

chapleau_report_resume.txt,Chapleau,report,"RESUMÉ.

1. That Chinese labor is a most efficient aid in the development of a. country, and a great means to wealth. As a railway navvy the Chinaman has no superior, and his presence in California has given the State a start many years ahead and added incalculably to its material prosperity ; while in British Columbia Chinese labor has been attended by great advantages to the Province and the same excellent effects would, most likely, for many years from now follow its utilization.

2. That, however, the Chinese being a non-assimilable race, clearly marked off from white people by color and national and race characteristics, their presence in a country is not unattended with disadvantages, foremost among these being the irritation, discontent and resentment they inspire in white laborers. Without discussing the reasonableness or otherwise of this antipathy, there it is ; and, as an important element in. the problem of the development and government of the country, it is a. fact for the State to consider in all its practical bearings.

3. That being able to subsist on much less than white men, they lower wages ; and the sentiment of race superiority on the part of the whites. leads these to feel humiliation at working by the side of Chinamen, the tendency being, as some contend, to bring labor into contempt.

4. That the Chinese do largely engross domestic service, in which they prove themselves faithful and efficient ; that the evidence was strong, if not conclusive, that white girls cannot be induced to go into the country, removed from their church and accustomed companionship, to work as domestics, and that a sufficient supply can not be had even for cities and towns ; that the fact that the Chinese thus compete with female servants. is, nevertheless, one well worthy the attention of Government.

5. That the tendency is for certain industries to pass completely into the hands of the Chinese.

6. That the statements as to their bad moral effect on the community are grossly exaggerated. In fact their morality is not lower than that of the same classes of other nationalities.

7. That their custom of living in quarters of their own-""Chinatowns"" -is attended with evils, such as the depreciation of property, and owing to their habits of lodging in crowded quarters and accumulating filth is. offensive if not likely to breed disease. But these evils might be dealt with by police supervision.

8. That they do not burden public charities nor unduly swell the calendar of crime.

9. On the point whether the Chinese have a quasi-government amongst themselves, the evidence is such as to leave the matter in doubt. It is probable, however, that what really exist are guilds and courts of arbitration. The Six Companies, about which so much is said, not only arose naturally in the early days, but such guilds are Chinese institutions found everywhere, and there can be no doubt that in China and Singapore such associations enable compradors to behave with great independence, not to say tyranny and peculation. Much of what has been said and written on this subject shows complete ignorance of Chinese character and habits. Chinamen invariably combine.

10. It would be very hard to say to which side educated public opinion in California leans on this subject of Chinese immigration. In British Columbia those who are not dependent in one way or another on the support of the laboring classes are, as a rule, unfavorable to anti-Chinese legislation. Everywhere the railway men and the mine owners, the manufacturers and the housekeepers, the merchants an'l shopkeepers are against absolute exclusion, but the very best friends of the Chinamen think their immigration should be regulated. In California an overwhelming vote was polled against them.

11. Assuming, as is done above, that the Chinese cannot be assimilated, it is well to pause before a choice of evils. If, for instance, they supply a want that cannot otherwise be supplied, labor where else great works would have to stop, help where else the weak and the old would in the discharge of their household duties sink beneath the burden of infirmity or age, then their presence so far from being an evil is a good. When other labor can be had, and other help is at hand, then would have been the time to think of dispensing wholly with the Chinese, and Congress undoubtedly went beyond the demands of some of the leaders in the anti-Chinese movement.

12. No one doubts that they have done a good day's work for the people of California. But if it is unfair on the one hand to complain after they have given value that they take the money out of the country, it would be equally illogical on the part of the Chinese, who professedly have never come to stay, to complain if the door is shut against new-comers. Those who have vested interests there are suffered to remain, and the wageearners who never intended to stop could claim no reversion for others.

13. That they show no desire to understand or meddle with politics, and take no or little interest in any country where they go to labor, and always intend to return to China; nor, save for the density of population in China, would there be reason to apprehend large permanent settlements of Chinese. But as that density must increase, necessity would in time lead to such settlements. This remark, however, should be made : although the climate of Northern China is cold, the immigrants who seek the western shores of this continent come and are sure to continue to come from provinces whose climate is either semi-tropical or borders on that ; nor need there be any fear of a Chinese inundation in Canada.

14. That no one, save a few persons of very ill-considered opinions, desires to exclude Chinese merchants, or any class of Chinese save two. All would exclude prostitutes and criminals. While numbers would welcome laborers on the ground of their usefulness, numbers would exclude them because they compete, or are supposed to compete, to the disadvantage of white laborers. It is universally admitted that the merchants are honorable and capable men, of high credit and of great commercial advantage to the community; and these would not only be welcomed but would be desirable.

15. That now (if here a speculative thought may enter) British Columbia has a great opportunity, by welcoming Chinamen, and thus securing not only cheaper labor than California, but conciliating the good will and fixing the attention of a people, from the vast resources and inchoate wealth of whose country the veil is only just being drawn aside, whose commerce is of great value, and on the completion of the Canadian Pacific Railway may be of incalculable value. British Columbia has many features in common with California. It is a country which needs local railways ; it is a mining country ; it is a fruitgrowing country. It possesses, besides, enormous resources in timber lands and fisheries. If, therefore, British Columbia were to decide that the undoubted evils of Chinese immigration were largely counterbalanced by other considerations, what would happen is this : she would by vigorous legislation secure that her mines would be worked on a large scale, the riches of the country being thus enormously increased and her treasury swelled ; she would engross nearly all the coal and timber trade and much of the fruit trade of the Pacific Coast, while her fish would largely supply the markets of the eastern and central parts of the continent, and even with Europe no insignificant commerce would be within her grasp ; her wealth positively and above all relatively to California would develop at a ratio not short of mathematical; she would literally shoot ahead as one of the great seats of commerce and industrial activity ; and, her position achieved, she could then apply herself to the political and social problem, and by the aid of the Dominion Parliament deal with that.

16. That the Chinese are most successful as market-gardeners. Perhaps in this character they are hardly equalled in the skill with which they bring the maximum of produce out of the ground, and though not clever in the management of horses, in the field they play a useful, if a subordinate part.

17. That if Chinamen dispensed with those conditions of Asiatic civilization which they have hitherto insisted on taking with them everywhere ; if their children were found more often than at present dressed in western garb and their books under their arm going to an English school, hostility to them would gradually disappear. In fact, a few bright Chinese school boys would do more for assimilation than all the measures of statesmen. There is little difference in appearance between a Chinaman who wears western clothes and makes a western toilet and the Portuguese or the Italian, who would be welcomed on whatever shores immigration was needed. The Japanese wins sympathy everywhere, and in some cases is actively encouraged because he adapts himself to the customs of the country in which he settles.

18. That the Chinaman in Victoria, B.C., under British rule, and in Portland under that of the United States, where the hostility to him is not so great as in the capital of California, is of a superior type to the Chinaman of San Francisco, and the inference is that he improves according as he is treated well.

19. That restrictive legislation in the United States has of necessity stimulated white immigration, but there is as yet no evidence that the supply would meet the needs of the country if the Chinese were to disappear.

20. That assuming Chinese immigrants of the laboring class will persist in retaining their present characteristics of Asiatic life, where these are strikingly peculiar and distinct from western, and that the influx will continue to increase, this immigration should be dealt with by Parliament ; but no legislation should be such as would give a shock to great interests and enterprises established before any probability that Parliament would interfere with that immigration arose. Questions of vested rights might come up, and these ought to be carefully considered before action is taken.

21. That, therefore, if restrictive legislation were considered opportune it should aim at gradually-achieved results, and the history of the question, as well as the evidence, shows that by legislation regulating, not excluding Chinese laborers, every purpose can be effected which those who apprehend evils from Chinese immigration could, and actually do desire.

22. That whenever legislation on this subject takes place its provisions should be of such a character as to avoid the difficulties, litigation and expense which have followed (as will be seen on pages cvi-cix, Enquiry at San Francisco,) the administration in the United States of the Restriction Acts of 1882 and 1884.

crease_commission.txt,Crease,report,"The Hon. Mr. Justice CREASE, Judge of the Supreme Court of British Columbia, submits the following answers :-

1. The classes of persons who come here as emigrants from China are almost entirely the lowest class of laborers or coolies, with a sprinkling of merchants ; no mechanics or artisans, no skilled laborers.

2. They usually arrive in good bodily health and fit for work. There was a cry of leprosy, but it was disproved by our own doctors.

3. There is no system of poor relief in British Columbia. There are no poor. There are benevolent societies, confined to particular nationalities (in name only), which extend aid in cases of sickness or the like. On these the Chinese do not come. They have their own benevolent society recently established. Previously their sick were sent to our hospitals and so became chargeable on our charity in hospital cases, or were cared for by their own people. They are never that I am aware of a burden on private charity.

4. They are kat' exocheen industrious, sober, economical and law-abiding, and in all those respects quite a pattern to the whites, and have always been so. It is because of these very qualities that white labor is jealous of them. As a class, indeed as individuals, they are neither lazy, drunken, extravagant nor turbulent. I have never seen in all these years (twenty-five) a drunken Chinaman. Occasionally on the railway works where they have suffered, or fancied they suffered great frauds at the hands of their own middlemen, sometimes even at the hands of the white foremen, they have resisted, and violent assaults have been the consequence. For these they have been severely punished whenever they have come before the courts. As in all large bodies of workmen, especially that lower substratum of labor from which some of our railway labor has been recruited, especially in British Columbia, bad individuals have been refractory and created trouble, but not more than, probably not so much as, on other similar works in the neighboring states. Among themselves (the Chinese) crimes of violence, even occasional murders have occurred, which from the secrecy of their mode of life, or our ignorance of it, have defied the investigations of the police. But this failure very likely arises from the almost universal ignorance in British Columbia of the Chinese language. There is not a single Anglo-Chinese dictionary or grammar to be obtained either here or at San Francisco. It has generally been supposed from the secrecy with which some murders were committed (they are confined to two or three Chinese murders altogether in many years), which have occurred in British Columbia undiscovered, that the victims were executed by the decrees of some secret Chinese tribunal, like the Vehm-Gericht, having its centre in San Francisco, but I have not been able to discover a single fact which tended to corroborate that suspicion.

5. They are punctual to the extreme in money matters. They think Their life made up, as much of a shilling as we do of a dollar. When they have by laborious degrees obtained money, they are as ready as any white man to enter into mining or other speculations all through the country. They are punctuality itself in meeting their pecuniary obligations and carrying out their contracts. In all these years that I have been continuously in British Columbia (namely, twenty-five), I do not know of a single case of a Chinaman who has been in the bankruptcy or insolvent court. This is not because they have not credit, for Chinese merchants, punctual to the day and hour in monetary engagements, can obtain what credit they please, (money is of no nationality), but this fact is accounted for because they are practically scrupulously honest. In all this they set an admirable example to white men. What British Columbia wants is small coin, and small economies, as a system to inculcate practically the habit of frugality.

6. In coming to British Columbia, and while here, the Chinese have no idea of interfering with the property of the white population in any way beyond the ordinary competition which they offer in the labor market. They are not mechanics or artisans.

7. When the Chinese first came to this place they supplied a felt want, one which had become almost intolerable in the way of labor and domestic service. The white settlers who first came to the country were very few in number, and had their own work to attend to. Those who followed in the search after gold all wanted to be ""bosses,"" or either their own masters or superintendents of other men's work. When the railway office was first opened for white laborers in British Columbia, out of every hundred some eighty wanted to be ""bosses."" The prices they charge for white labor here have, ever since I have been here-that is, since my arrival in 1858-been simply prohibitive to the ordinary employer of labor : $2, $2.50, and even at times $3 a day for ordinary labor ; for mechanics, $3, $4, $5, or more per day. All the first settlers who came here arrived without money. It required a large sum, as well as a long time, an adventurous spirit, and lots of pluck even to get here with a family, 15,000 miles from home in those days. The country was a wilderness. All food and manufactured articles, such as clothing, tools, machinery, etc., were exceedingly dear. We had houses, churches, gaols, court-houses, and all other buildings to erect ; roads through forest and swamp to clear out and build ; trunk roads through the country in all directions to make ; in short, everything required for civilization the first settlers had to do ab initio, out of their own labor and savings, or money they could borrow from San Francisco. All this was effected without assistance from the imperial treasury, which, in every other British colony, had contributed largely to launch its infant offspring into political life. British Columbia had to be, and was, self-supporting from its birth. There is no other British colony with such a record. The proximity of British Columbia to its flourishing neighbor, the United States, while in some respects a great advantage-for this country at first possessed no capital or staple until gold broke out, and was dependent not only for capital, but for breadstuffs, cattle, clothing, groceries, indeed supplies of all kinds, on San Francisco and Oregon-was in other respects a great disadvantage. All the white labor which failed in obtaining in British Columbia the high pay expected, had only to cross the border, an imaginary line close at hand, to obtain it. The Indians could not be depended upon at first on account of their numbers, which in those days were threatening, nor afterwards on account of their restless, nomadic propensities, which prevented them settling down to any permanent, industrious avocations. The English settlers had all the household and servile occupations to discharge themselves : chop and cut wood, get water, clean the dishes, pots and pans ; cook, wash, bake, sew, and rear families, and discharge all the other onerous and multifarious duties of the ménage. In this strait a few, myself among the number, chartered several ships with female servants from England round the Horn. We paid £30 ($150) a head for their passage, on engagements of gradual repayment out of wages at colonial rates after they arrived-a payment which, with a few honorable exceptions, I need hardly say, was rarely ever made. That proving a complete failure, Kanakas from the Sandwich Islands were tried and also failed ; so, by the mere process of exhaustion no resource was left but Chinese labor, which was accordingly employed, at first, very reluctantly. Every one had a great and not unnatural objection to try them ; but necessity has no law, it was Chinese labor or none at all. At first they were imported from San Francisco in isolated instances ; but gradually as the white woman saw her neighbor get some relief from the killing domestic slavery of colonial life she also adopted them, and, by the sheer necessity of the case, their employment as domestic servants became general, and at last universal. Such white labor as could be had was eminently unsatisfactory, not only on account of scarceness and price, but because, especially female servants, they would not submit to consider themselves in the household arrangements as in any respect subordinate to their employers. Immigrants who went to the mines, as in Cariboo, could get $10 a day, and some of them got claims yielding in many instances, and for a considerable period 600 ounces of gold to every wash-up. Success of this kind made ordinary labor to those engaged in that avocation ever after distasteful. It is not too much to say that without Chinese servants the privations in family life, extreme and of wearying monotony, would have become intolerable, and a general exodus of families would have been the result. Indeed as it was numerous industrious settlers with wives and families were driven out of the country on that account. The high prices the Chinese obtained from the first, as wages, up to the present day, are a very fair test of the necessity for their employment. From $15 per month, the lowest to an inferior man, up to $35 a month for the best (with board and lodging be it remembered) have been the continuous rates. Young boys, even $8 or $10. It is a singular fact that Chinese servants are the only class of people that are positively paid to learn their duty. This arises from their peculiar facility in adapting themselves to any work they have to learn, and their success in acquiring that knowledge. But if white servants, who would do the same work, and as well, at anything like the same wages, and who could be depended on to stay, were to offer themselves, they would have been gladly accepted. But as a rule white domestic labor such as it is has constantly been tried and found wanting. White laborers attracted from the East by the prices here, invariably ""fall into the ways of the country,"" and refuse to work at anything like what ordinary employers of labor consider reasonable or practicable rates. The relief given by Chinese aid to overworked households when sorely needed created a good feeling towards them. This good feeling lasted for some time. Their number was limited and no serious fears had yet been entertained of their competition in the labor market.

8. This good feeling continued more or less until about the time of the commencement of the Canadian Pacific Railway works in the province.

9. Then a very laudable feeling arose that, if possible, such a vast expenditure of public money should be utilized by bringing into the province white settlers, who should become heads of families, take root in the soil and add greatly to the substantial strength of the Dominion. To this end it was deemed desirable that all the labor on the railway should be white labor, whose earnings would be spent and invested in the country, instead of going to a foreign country. And then began the cry, “No Chinese need apply !"" But experience soon showed that the hope of any exclusive employment of white labor was far from being realized. The American and continental railways were simultaneously large rival bidders in the labor market. White labor in quantity and quality sufficient was unattainable, and nothing is more certain than that in the absence of Chinese labor the enormous railway works, which are now progressing to completion, would have been indefinitely prolonged, if not postponed to the Greek Kalends from sheer want of hands. The outcry against the Chinese takes its rise in a great measure in the efforts of persons, who, for political motives, are desirous of posing themselves as the friends of the working classes, through their sweet votes to gain political power and influence. All political parties, the ""ins "" as well as the "" outs,"" aim at this ; and through the press and orations, and even no little misrepresentation, -exaggerate. Admitted objections to their being adopted as citizens, and to too large an influx of a heathen element in our midst, were distorted into a desire for the proscription of the whole race. The bait to the working man : the exclusive command of the labor market. All political parties tend to this, and urge collectively the passing of laws which they do not hesitate, as individuals, to class as unconstitutional, in the hope that by constant clamor and agitation, in one direction, to overbear all the solid considerations on the other side, to break through all treaties which place Chinese on an equal footing with other nations, to impose illegal taxes and discriminating restrictions so that that may be obtained by injustice and persecution which could never be expected from justice and right. The object of course being to restrict the admission or, if possible, procure the total exclusion of Chinese labor and to win the sweet votes of the working man. The practical result of which, if successful, would necessarily be to create the worst of all monopolies, next to that of capital : the tyranny of labor under whose withering blight mines, fisheries, manufactures, arts, and improvements of all kinds would speedily languish or die, and the development of the country, to which it is undeniable the labor of the Chinese has so largely contributed, would be indefinitely retarded and cui bono ?

10. One chief outcry has been against their habits and mode of living as being injurious to the public peace and health. Coming from a swarming population in China, and, as I have stated, of the lower order of coolies, they have undoubtedly a tendency to congregate ; at all events to submit to being cooped in large numbers within a small area. But this in British Columbia is directly owing to the fact that as foreigners, held in dangerous disesteem by an active section of the whites, they naturally cling together for protection and support. Their very language keeps them together and apart from the whites; but much of this overcrowding is attributable to the whites themselves, who extort heavy rents from them for very scant house accommodation, and they accentuate the very evil for which in public they profess such profound dislike. Much has been said of their immorality, habits of prostitution, opium dens and gambling houses, and there is a. certain amount, indeed too great an amount, of truth in these accusations. It would be unreasonable to expect that a low class of laborers in any country should be free from such evils. All these, however, can be as readily dealt with by the police as the same vicious habits among the whites. Indeed the latter in several respects do not gain by the comparison. For the Chinese do not parade their vices ; their prostitutes do not set up large houses in the most prominent places, with brass plates on the door, or ply their trade with an air of semi-publicity, nor drive about in open carriages, or flaunt themselves on public race courses and assemblages, or advertise for the payment of debts due to them through the medium of the public press. Their ""opium dens "" and ""gambling dens "" are all known to the police and capable of being suppressed. But what of the white dens : whiskey establishments, and gambling saloons, and the sale of liquor to Indians, who get it by the canoe load and wholesale ? I do not say that all these evils whether white or Chinese should not be determinedly suppressed, but there is such a manifest spirit of exaggeration in the complaints that are made, for the purpose I have described, as very materially to lessen in impartial eyes the accusations levelled against the Chinese. They are as a class very cleanly in their persons ; indeed, as to all those matters laid to their charge, they are no worse than the same things done in our midst by white men themselves. If enquiry were made of the railway servants and the engineers on the permanent railway cuttings, what an account they can give of white, as well as Chinese abominations that abound there. Who that has seen a leading mainland town on the railway line on pay-days can ever forget the disgusting sights that everywhere met his eyes ? Furious drunken men in the streets, saloons and corners at all hours of the day and night, week-days and Sundays all alike, the fights, the uproar, the gambling, that made day and night hideous, besotted drunken whites kicked out of the houses, prostrate in the morning in the places where they fell over night sleeping off the effects of the previous debauch, only to stagger up and engage again in the same round of vice. These are the sights which one would fain forget, with other things about which the pen blushes to write.

11. But without the Chinese in any event the province could never have been developed as far as it has at present progressed. The best test of that is that we cannot, at present at all events, do without them. Their presence is not only necessary but in many respects desirable for the simple reason that the work must be done, and can only be done-in a province and by people, still very poor-through the agency of the Chinese or some similar labor. There is none other procurable at present which can do the work well.

13. If we ask ourselves what would be the effect of their suddenly going hence compulsorily or otherwise, the answer is immediate and overwhelming. The railway works would ""peter out"" for want of labor to construct them. The canneries would instantly be stopped. The shoe and other manufactories the same. The farmers would be at once injuriously affected. The coal mines would in several most important instances be abandoned. Improvements now only possible by Chinese labor would come to a sudden end, and the misery-domestic misery to 80 out of every 100 families here-would, to those who have not gone through it for so many years as we have, be inconceivable. It would be perfectly appalling. The wail of the housewife would sweep through the land, and find a very decided expression in every husband's vote at the polls, and that in a manner not very flattering to those who now affect to be the white laborer's friends. There is an unreality about this outcry against the Chinese that strikes one directly he takes pen in hand to write about the cry. on the subject. The advocates of exclusion make all the greater fuss over it, one is tempted to opine, the less likelihood they may think there is of its being carried out. The strike of the Chinese in Victoria when resisting an intentionally discriminating and illegal tax of $30 a head on all Chinese - although it occurred a few years ago-is too fresh in the recollection to be forgotten. The travelling public would soon let their voices be heard against such an exclusion ; for hotels and boarding houses would be shut up, or offer utterly inadequate accommodation. Every house would have to grow its own vegetables or pay an extortionate white price for them. Indeed the whole country would be in an uproar, and all its industries and progress would receive a check from which it would take many years of great suffering to recover-and for what ? All for a political cry : ""We are ruined by Chinese cheap labor !"" Yes ! The commonest manual labor cheap at from $15 to $35 a month and found !

14. The real fact is, and the more completely it is recognized the better, that we cannot do without a certain number of Chinese for manual labor and for domestic servants, and that throughout all British Columbia. For any great works, too, which have to be carried out, such for instance as railways, Chinese manual labor cannot at present be dispensed with. Good white labor is so far superior to Chinese, that it will of itself, when it can be contented with reasonable prices as in the East, infallibly work Chinese manual labor out of the field. No reasonable man will employ the labor of a person whose language he can never understand if he can get even as good service from one who cannot mistake his orders and can enter into all his wishes for the work in hand. But what is as necessary for the white man as the Chinaman is, that he should be sober, honest and steady at his work, and exhibit a fair share of all those qualities which go to constitute good labor. A certain number are at present an absolute necessity. At present all told, including the Chinese on railway works, and along the whole line, about 13,000. Of these there are probably only 5,000 or 6,000 engaged in domestic and family out-door work in the province including those in mines and canneries. So useful indeed have they been found that even in coal mines they have been employed by working miners themselves to assist them as their servants in getting out the, coal. They do not compete at all with mechanics, artisans, or handicraftsmen, or in any skilled labor. They are good market-gardeners, fair servants, and tolerable laborers; imitate quickly and learn quickly, and are good traders and merchants et voilà tout. They will never assimilate with the Anglo-Saxon race, nor is it desirable that they should. Certain degrees of labor contract of limited duration, amounting while it lasts to a species of slavery, are said to be common among them. Like all low classes of people they have a low estimate of women. They do not regard British Columbia as their home and when they die send their bones home to he buried in China.

15. It is very difficult, almost an impossibility, to fix any definite limit or even approximate of the proportion which Chinese immigration should bear to white immigration, if the best interests of the colony and the comfort of the people are to be regarded ; and if only for this reason that no matter how many white people come to British Columbiah, they all come expecting certain rates, rates which British Columbians have not got the money to pay. If they do not get these rates, it is not as in Australia where they are obliged to stay, they can just skip over the boundary line into the United States, and there even if they do not get what they exact, they get more than than they can in a more newly settled country, and we never see them again. They go to swell the numbers and volume of the United States, just as the Swift, the Quesnelle, the Thompson and Lillctt Rivers and other affluents go to swell the depth and volume of the Fraser, or the colonies of England add strength and depth and volume to the British Empire. If restriction of the Chinese took place, those who are here already would at once raise their price, and thus the very object of the anti-Chinese would be indirectly gained, and we should once more be without domestic help, once more thrown back twenty years upon our own resources. If one could venture on an estimate it would be at the rate of one Chinaman to each family, counting as in Europe each average family as consisting of four persons. Probably, if there were no great railway or other works to be considered, if twenty per cent. of the population were Chinese, we might get on fairly well. But every one of these would at once on his arrival find remunerative employment.

16. If the domestic servants coming from Europe or other parts of America were the only ones we could obtain, no persons of capital would (if they knew the truth) think of coming to British Columbia. They can get all the comforts and luxuries they may wish in other and cheaper places. They simply would not come-that is come to reside.

17. The answers I have already given to the previous questions sufficiently answer this one, except as to this :

18. I do not think at present any restriction on Chinese immigration is necessary or expedient. Time should be given to see whether those at present in the country who are engaged solely on railway works, will not leave the country altogether as soon as the works which drew them hither are concluded. Though possessed of all the qualities I have described, Chinamen do not make good settlers in the sense of raising up citizens of a free. and progressive country, which must in the course of years aspire to nationality however far remote the time. Miscegenation with the race is on any scale impossible. Patriotism is not known among them. In their legal contentions in court among their economies is a remarkable economy of truth. Six witnesses will get up and swear positively and to the point on one side, when six will get up and swear point blank the reverse, contradicting every allegation with a circumstance. This may be attributable to two things : our ignorance of the proper mode of binding their conscience by an oath, or our ignorance of their language which prevents our being able to sift out the truth as we could when white witnesess swear directly opposite to each other with respect to the same facts.

19. As to a combined effort of the people and the legislature to encourage white immigration, I do not believe, though most of all to be desired and encouraged, that such a combination, with the unlimited United States alongside, would succeed to any appreciable extent. The moment this combined effort ""furnished an effectual supply of white labor "" to the colour at any given time, I cannot possibly believe that it would stay supplied. The moment an immigrant "" laborer "" touches British Columbia he becomes in his own mind a boss (as it is termed) and will do as little manual labor as he can help. I exclude from this consideration all choppers, timber-men and the like. They never seem to lose the old time spirit for their work. The axe to them is a handicraft which no white man not born or educated up to the mark, can imitate. So with the regular miner and blaster. He is almost alone in his art; but I speak of the mere laborer. He can get rich land and a homestead for a mere nothing and become a farmer, and in a short time an employer of labor himself, looking out very likely for "" the first Chinaman that comes along "" whom he may "" boss.'

20. To the question can white people find now remunerative employment and steady work and a provision for old age, I answer, yes, most certainly, plenty of work .. if they do not want it all at once. That is the trouble. The world, the Columbia world, is to him that can work and wait ; and I may add success requires here the same kind of qualities as ensure it anywhere else, sobriety, industry and honesty. Here there are no poor. To men with such qualities success is a mere question of time, especially here. British Columbia with its opportunities, unrivalled climate, regular succession of seasons, and unlimited resources, is a paradise to the poor man.

21. The railway and the opening of the railway lands has already had a marked effect upon the immigration of settlers to this province. I presume it is within the scope of these enquiries to add that survey should precede  or as quickly as possible overtake "" settlement,"" and much more information as to what lands in particular are open to settlement should be given to intending settlers. There has been a great stride in that direction under the present government of the province, but it is a difficult thing to do, and certain preparation is required. But these things prepared, a great increase of immigration can well be provided for in British Columbia. There is a very erroneous impression about the agricultural capabilities of British Columbia, or I should say incapabilities. It cannot be called an agricultural country, compared with the level, arable plains of the interior of North America ; but there is good agricultural land enough to support millions of population, but first comers require assistance, British Columbia is so far away from most countries.

22. Instead of being retarded by Chinese immigration, I am fully persuaded that white immigration has been assisted by it. I know of retired officers and persons of settled incomes who would not have thought of coming here if they had not known that Chinese servants could he had here, though very indifferent compared with those one can obtain in China itself.

23. I do not think the effect produced by the Chinese on the morals of the whites has been a beneficial one, for the simple fact that they are heathens, and some quantity, I believe, of the whites are Christians. But where there are white people of allied habits to the immoral among the Chinese they are more likely to be injurious to their fellow whites than any Chinese, not only from intelligent depravity, but because they have from their language greater facility in communicating the moral virus and ill example to both old and young.

24. No. The proportion of immoral people among the Chinese here is not more than among white people similarly situated, where there are no immoral persons Chinese.

25. For open wickedness and parade of vice, for the public defence and spread of it in various alluring forms, for the numbers of youths inoculated by it, there is no comparison between the two; white vice and depravity are far ahead, more insidious, more alluring, more permanently injurious.

26. I have no personal knowledge whatever of the presence of leprosy among the Chinese. Now and then one hears a report to that effect, but in those cases reported upon by English doctors they have denied altogether its existence. They have, I believe, some singular and peculiar illnesses among themselves, such as produce wasting away and death, but these do not spread beyond themselves, although said to be almost invariably fatal among that people.

27. No. I have not spoken of the legal aspect of the Chinese question, restrict or exclude as that is not before me ; nor have I alluded to the treaties, as these subjects will naturally come in their order before the Commission, and are, after all, matter of diplomatic negotiation. But I do as a citizen and a very old, early pioneer of British Columbia, deprecate any active step whatever being taken, since my opinion has been asked-certainly for the present either to restrict or exclude Chinese immigration into British Columbia. It would not take so much as is generally supposed to drive them entirely out of the country, the effect of which would be simply disastrous. I am aware it is a matter even now in serious discussion among some of their leading men here, and these have been advised before taking any active step in that direction to await the result of this Commission. Of its existence and objects they are well aware, and expect its report with an interest they do not affect to conceal, for it will, for good or evil, affect, and that perhaps for a long period, enormous interests-social, financial, and political.

HENRY P. PELLEW CREASE.",0
begbie_commission.txt,Begbie,report,"Sir MATTHEW BEGBIE, Chief Justice of British Columbia, returned the following answers:

1. Chinamen in British Columbia appear to follow any description of industry which may appear useful, i.e., in which they can obtain employment or earn their livelihood. I should say by far the larger number of them trust to the pick and shovel: either agricultural, or road-making, or mining. There are many who mine for gold on their own account, working chiefly on the bars of rivers and water-courses, with rockers and flumes. Many are, or were recently, employed at Nanaimo in coal mines, both above and below ground. Many undertake gardening and small farms. Another large class take to domestic service; scarcely any establishment in the province has any other servants. Another large class take to trade; they have the whole business of supplying their fellow countrymen, and some firms compete with the most respectable Europeans in general trade. The menial businesses of washing and of splitting and Chinese washer sawing stovewood are almost entirely engrossed by Chinamen. I do not believe there are many mechanics, properly so-called. I only know of their being employed in two manufactures: shoes and cigars. There are few carpenters. They are employed about every building; but generally as mixers of mortar, hodmen, wheel-barrowmen: not as masons, or brick- layers, or carpenters. Every Chinaman in British Columbia has the air of having worked, and of being ready to work, with his hands, except a few who practice as medical men and the leading commercial men.

2. So far as I have observed, they are invariably ready and anxious to go to any kind of work immediately on their arrival here; and fit for work so far as health is concerned.

3. I am sorry to say we have no system of public poor relief, or of public relief of any kind, except the hospitals and the asylum. Chinamen do not much trouble the hospitals. I never heard of Chinamen becoming a burden on the private charity of the whites. I have an indistinct remembrance of having been once asked to contribute to the cost of removing a disabled Chinaman; I am not sure. Such cases must be extremely rare. Nothing is more common than to be called on to relieve whites by private charity.

4. To answer this question fully is to destroy the force and meaning of the answer. Industry, economy, sobriety, and law-abidingness are exactly the four prominent qualities of Chinamen as asserted both by their advocates and their adversaries. Lazy, drunken, extravagant, and turbulent: this is, by the voices of their friends and foes, exactly what a Chinaman is not. This is, on the whole, I think, the real cause of their unpopularity. If Chinamen would only be less industrious and economical, if they would but occasionally get drunk, they would no longer be the formidable competitors with the white man which they prove to be in the labor market; there would be no longer a cry for their suppression. They would not be liked; the two races are too dissimilar, and each has too high an opinion of his own deserts. But they would not be hated; in fact they would not be here to excite hatred. The reason why they are here is, because their peculiar qualities command a ready market. If they had not these qualities, nobody would want them. If nobody wanted them, they would not come. But these qualities meet with no competition here; and the Chinaman sees no person to take his place were he to abdicate it. I have heard an individual Chinaman stigmatized as ""lazy ;"" but the fact was he conceived himself insulted, and was sulking. Their never-ending, ceaseless toil is like nothing but an ant-hill. I cannot recall to memory that I ever saw or heard of a Chinaman being drunk. Extravagant they certainly are not, though they live well when they can afford it, both inside and out: chicken and silk jacket. And they certainly do sometimes run in debt, both in trade debts and in gambling, which is their chief vice. There is scarcely an epithet so removed from the notion of a Chinaman as ""turbulent,"" though of course they may be provoked to resist violence. They are somewhat given to petty thefts, and so not thefts. invariably law-abiding. But these thefts are rarely, if ever, accompanied by violence or threats against the person. Indeed it may be conjectured that they generally steal through want. For, looking to their universal. employment as domestics, their large brotherhoods, necessarily impenetrably secret to the whites, and the unguarded condition of our houses, the pilfering by Chinamen servants is really quite inconsiderable. I believe that two of the white servants I have had have pilfered more from me  than any twenty Chinamen in Victoria ever stole from their employers..

5. Yes; better than white men do with each other. They are notoriously excellent tenants, paying rent punctually.

6. So far as I see, I do not quite understand how they could, except, perhaps, in commerce. They have some firms, wealthy and busy for British Columbia firms; but I do not think these compete for European consignments.

7. Those who stayed in Victoria and the lower country, chiefly engaged in domestic service, washing, etc. These certainly supplied a want then felt; but I do not think they were ever much encouraged or welcomed, except that they found employment readily on terms satisfactory to themselves. The greater part took their picks and shovels to the gold mines. I cannot say they were much wanted there; nor was their coming there, so far as I recollect, much welcomed or encouraged. On the contrary, they were from the first thoroughly unpopular in the mines; the mining population being very Californian in its prejudices, its likings and dislikings. Nor do I think that the feeling has much changed, although they now go quite freely to the Cariboo, and have for many years; also to the Cassiar. They did not go to those districts at first, for obvious reasons; I think the police could scarcely have guaranteed them.

8 and 9. I do not think that the feeling of the whites against Chinamen has much changed; but I do not recollect anything that can be called ""agitation "" against them until Confederation. The agitation is of the same description as that felt by the hand-loom weavers against the power-looms; by the flail-wielders against the threshing-machines in England fifty years ago; by the Solway fishermen against the stake-nets in the last century; by the lower orders in many parts of Europe against the Jews; and by the coal-miners in Pennsylvania against the machineborers at the present day. That seems to be the impulsive force which brings into action the ever-present dislike between the Indo-Caucasian and this branch of Mongolians. This dislike, which otherwise might lie dormant or inert, is certainly mutual; it is manifested in China, we are- told, more extensively and stringently than here, and without any impulse  there from direct competition for bread. Europeans at Canton or Shanghai are not safe beyond their allotted cantonments, any more than a Chinaman would have been on Williams Creek twenty years ago. The Chinaman is in every respect the reverse of an European, except that he is a man. His religion, his notions of honor and rank, his mode of thought, his dress, his amusements, his sense of beauty, his vices, are not to our taste at all, or such as we can take to or even understand; and his language, spoken or written, appears to us at once incomprehensible and ridiculous. Yet they as evidently despise all our attainments and ways; and, what is most annoying, they come here and beat us on our own ground in supplying our own wants. They are inferior, too, in weight and size of muscle, and yet they work more steadily and with better success on the average than white men.

A distinguished political writer of the present day speaking of the Judenhetze in Europe, thus expresses himself :

"" What is it that in every age, and in so many and in so different countries, not only ancient, but to-day, in Russia, Germany, Roumania, causes this hatred of the Jews? An intuitive antipathy, jealousy mingled with contempt. The Roumanian finds himself in company with a large number of people of alien race, of feelings, traditions and religion quite different from his-people who do not own the same ties of fatherland as he, who do not intermarry with him or his kindred, and whose domestic institutions are unknown and perhaps unintelligible to him. So in Germany. There can be no doubt that the Judenhetze derived its strength, not from the historical arguments of Professor Von Treitschke nor from the Christian arguments of court preacher Stoeker, but from the widespread sense that the Jews were out-bidding the Christian Germans in the market.""

Evidently such competition must be put down. In the central portions of Europe, this is attempted in a barbarous way-by brute force, by fire and bludgeons. But countries of a higher political organization are provided with more tranquil and equally effective methods; and, with a few regrettable exceptions, these latter methods only, in the main, have been pursued here. Accordingly, before the close of the First Parliament after Confederation, Chinamen were deprived of the right of franchise, which they had previously enjoyed. This was on the ostensible ground that all Chinamen were actuated merely by direct money considerations. It is highly probable that they are as accessible to bribery as the ordinary white voter, but I am not aware that any enquiry was made or evidence aken on the point. On the other hand, some years later, it was sworn in evidence before the Kootenay Commission, 1878, that the majority of voters (at that time all whites) in a certain district had received money for their votes at the last previous election. This statement passed without comment or contradiction. No disfranchisement was suggested on this ground. Everything else follows logically. The constituencies are of exclusively white race, with no property qualification. Members of the legislature in a constitutional state are in duty bound to take the views of their constituencies as expressed at the polls; and to support such measures as please their constituents. This is their ratio existendi, unless they do so, they would at the next election cease to be returned. A constitutional ministry is bound to see their line of duty in the path indicated by the votes of the majority of the house-they are, in fact, a sort of managing committee to carry into effect the wishes of that majority. They hold office on that condition. And what the local house cannot enact of itself, they, and their committee of management, are bound to obtain or attempt by all the means in their power to obtain from the superior legislature.

The same distinguished writer whom I have already quoted on the Judenhetze, observes, in speaking of the rival programmes in the existing presidential campaign in the United States: ""The Irish vote or the republican working man cannot be wooed successfully without attacks on the bloated capitalist, on English tyranny or treachery, or on the unfortunate immigrants from China.” Mutato nomine. The names of races and states may be changed, but human nature remains the same with Celt, and Slave, and Semite, and Mongolian.

10. I do not think their habits or mode of life are really injurious to the public peace or the public health; not more than the habits of the whites. There are several matters alleged against Chinamen: One is the extraordinarily small space into which a cluster of them will retire for rest. Four or five, or even ten or twelve, will be on a raised platform, almost like a litter of puppies. It is said this is dangerous in a sanitary view. I believe it is forbidden in London to lodge people for hire, without a certain number of cubic feet in the room to each inmate. But I have seen in a good-sized house, where there was plenty of cubic space, and where each person might have had a separate bunk, five or six Chinamen, not lodgers but owners, sleeping in a heap as above described. It does not appear to affect their health unfavorably.

It is common to attribute to Chinamen generally, that they are infested with disgusting diseases -- e. g., leprosy. I believe this is pure imagination; an absolutely unfounded report. When an orator talks of Chinese lepers, it is exactly the same unmeaning abuse as when a Canton periodical holds out to popular indignation the foreign ""red devils."" There is no leprosy or diabolism in the case; though of course a Chinaman, like any other man, may be a leper. The orator merely wishes to impress his audience with the belief that 'he strongly objects to Chinamen. But if the orator be in a position to keep a servant, he certainly keeps at his home one or more of these ""lepers,"" who cook all his food, wash all his clothes, his glasses and his plate, waits at his table, kneads all the pastry he eats, and makes all the beds he and his family sleep in. A Chinaman was once pointed out to me who was alleged to be a leper. No doubt he had a very disgusting skin disease; I did not examine him at all; on the contrary, I kept as far off as possible. It may have been leprosy, which is not always identical in its manifestations. He seemed to be quite as shocking to his own countrymen as to the whites. He was being shipped away when pointed out to me. That was the only case of skin disease I remember to have noticed or heard of among Chinamen. Such diseases, generally the result of vice, or hereditary taint, are by no means unknown here among the whites and half- breeds. I have seen many. These certainly were not contracted from Chinamen.

It is alleged against them that they are inordinately given to the use of opium I do not know whether eaten, or smoked, or both-and that their example is dangerous to the whites. I altogether disbelieve in any widespread mischief here from opium. Most nations and tribes in the world, even savages, are given to the use of sedatives or narcotics of some description. The Chinese, and I believe other Asiatic nations, use opium extensively. In whole provinces, each as large as England, the poppy is the chief agricultural crop, all for home use, none being exported. The enormous consumption which this implies does not appear to prevent Chinamen from being the most prolific race, the most indefatigable laborers, and the keenest traders in the world. If any Chinamen here abuse the drug by over-indulgence, they must hide themselves, or at all events they have entirely escaped my observation. If their example persuades any white people to similar over-indulgence, of which I am equally ignorant, these must be a very degraded class-weaker and more degraded than the Chinaman whose expulsion is demanded. Opium, as generally used here, is probably as harmless as tobacco, which is also extensively used in British Columbia by Chinamen. They have manufactories here for their own consumption; and they probably consume far more tobacco than opium. Neither opium nor tobacco extend in their evil effects beyond the individual. They are not nearly as dangerous to the public peace as whiskey. I am very far from thinking, and I wish not to be understood as at all insinuating, that whiskey causes crime, or induces a criminal intention; on the contrary, it seems reasonable to hold that intoxication often renders a criminal intention impossible, and still more often lessens the criminality of the offence, which, committed deliberately by a sober man, would evince a deeper hue of guilt. But there can be no doubt but that drunkenness is the most frequent occasion of crime; that far more offences are committed by men under the influence of liquor than when in their sober senses. And to the injured party the offence is just as great, and very nearly as great to the community; whether committed under whiskey or not. All the evils arising from opium in British Columbia in a year do not, probably, equal the damage, trouble and expense occasioned to individuals and to the state by whiskey in a single month, or perhaps in some single night, As already observed, I do not remember ever to have seen a drunken Chinaman; and the argument against Chinamen founded on opium appears to be analogous to the comparison of the mote and the beam.

It is alleged that not only the aggregation of Chinamen in their dwellings is a source of danger to the public health, but that their habits are filthy. This last allegation I take to be mere unfounded abuse, if directed against them as a race. There are of course dirty Chinamen. Many of them are very poor, and are, perhaps, as dirty as poor white people; but that they are as a race dirty, or believed to be dirty, seems quite incompatible with the fact that they are as a race unanimously invested with a virtual monopoly of the two occupations requiring the highest degree of personal cleanliness, viz., cooking and washing. Any family in British Columbia will, at once, without any enquiry as to his cleanliness, admit the first Chinaman who offers as a cook-where a cook is wanted; and really it may be said that no washing is given out to people of any other nation. As to danger to the public peace, they are, I think, less inclined to crimes of personal violence, than men of any other races.They are occasionally dishonest, but the fact that they have (as being the races. vast majority of domestic servants) more opportunities for pilfering, than all the other inhabitants of British Columbia put together, and that very few serious thefts are laid to their charge, seems conclusive on this point.

11. Whether the presence of Chinamen is any longer desirable in British Colombia, is to a certain extent a matter of opinion. But as to the past, the undoubted facts are: 1st. That Chinamen are very large till within a year, mainly, employed in all the laborious parts of our coal mines ; 2nd. They constitute three-fourths of the working hands about every salmon cannery; 3rd. They are a very large majority of the laborers employed in gold mining; 4th. They are the model market gardeners of the province, and produce the greater part of the vegetables grown here; 5th. They have been found to be absolutely indispensable in the construction of the railway; 6th. They are largely, sometimes exclusively, employed in nearly every manufactory or undertaking of any description, not being under the authority of a board or council elected exclusively by white voters.

12. This is again a matter of opinion. I do not see how people would get on here at all without Chinamen. They do, and do well, what white get on without women cannot do, and do what white men will not do. If Chinamen were expelled, employers of labor would probably have to leave the province; and when they were gone, where would the employed be?

13. I do not know. Probably most people who now employ servants would go away. All canneries and many other successful establishments would be closed. The railway works (construction and repairs) would necessarily be suspended. People with any realized property who remained (if any remained) would be very uncomfortable, I should apprehend. People without any means would probably have very few employers to support them.

14. I should say, not a certain number, but an uncertain number, are necessary to be retained; to be imported, if all those now here should depart. How many depends upon circumstances. The supply would probably regulate itself as does the supply of horses. Would it be advisable. to banish all horses from the province? To do so, would open out many opportunities for white men's labor. Would it be desirable to secure a supply of half a million of horses ? They would probably eat us all up: i.e., devour all our means of subsistence. There are supposed to be in California more than 120,000 Chinamen. It is probable that in that state, as in British Columbia, a good deal more than half the manual labor is performed by Chinamen. It is, perhaps, worth while to refer to the condition of labor in the Californian vineyards and hop-grounds as mentioned quite incidentally in the San Francisco Weekly Bulletin, 10th September, 1884, and consider what would be the effect on the development of our infant agricultural country if half its laborers, and of its powers of supply of laborers, were suddenly cut off. The result might of course be ultimately beneficial ; but it is difficult to resist the opposite conclusion.

"" Within a radius of two miles there are at this time no less than 500 Chinamen engaged in gathering the hop crop. So far as I can judge from a casual examination, the yield will be about equal to that of last year, and the quality of the hops excellent. It is quite an interesting sight to watch the process of picking and drying. For a field of twenty-five or thirty acres about 100 Chinamen are employed. They pick, two together, into large boxes, which hold 140 to 150 pounds of green hop. The two poles which are set in each hill of hops are pulled down, and the mass of hops laid across the box, which is covered with an apron to prevent the leaves falling in. The Chinamen work by contract, and they rush from morning till night, seeming never to tire. As soon as a box is filled a loud yell informs the foreman, who brings a sack, into which the box is emptied, and the Chinamen are given a check. Two Chinamen can pick from two to three boxes in a day, and as they receive $1.50 per box it will be seen that they are earning white men's wages. Last year they only received $1.25, but help at this time is scarce and the China bosses had only to demand the raise and get it. It is understood that they will demand $1:25 a day for grape picking, and no doubt the demand will have to be complied with.""

15. This involves a calculation of an almost impossible nature; quite impossible for me. What are the best interests of the colony? Who knows what white people may come here? In what number, or what seeking, or for what qualified ?

16. It is of course impossible to prophesy; but as far as I can judge of human nature, the first cargo of capitalists, under the supposed conditions, would not stop here long, and would frighten all other cargoes away. A capitalist, with any common sense, wants either to enjoy his money or to employ it; which are indeed the only two plans by which his capital can be of advantage to his fellow man. But if the supply of service were limited, as mentioned in the question, it seems very clear that he could neither employ nor enjoy his money, and he would take himself elsewhere. I do not say that the sum of human felicity here, or anywhere, would be diminished by the absence of capitalists; but there is surely no method so likely to deter them as to limit in any way the supply of the only importable article which they really require. The greatest natural advantages in fisheries, mines, ports, are quite sterile unless operated on by labor, and capital is necessary to support that labor. But capital alone would be quite useless without labor; and would be little likely either to visit or remain in a province, where it would merely consume away.

It does not seem generally understood by those who work with their hands, that unless the result of their handiwork, is marketably worth more than the money they receive for wages, their employment must soon stop. The lowest limit of wages is the money which will buy the necessaries of life for the laborer. The highest limit is the whole of the augmented value which his labor confers on the material operated on. If the laborer accepts less than the first, he will die of want. If the employer give the whole of the second, he will leave himself nothing to live upon, and will speedily die of want in his turn, unless he more speedily retire from his undertaking and place his capital in the funds: when he will at last get interest. Between these two impassable limits the rate of wages oscillates according to supply and demand. Now the only paying industries here are the canneries and shoe factories, in both of which the labor is almost exclusively Chinese. Owing to a very great superiority in the mineral, the coal mines have paid largely, notwithstanding the rates of white miners wages, unequalled elsewhere; but the coal mines have hitherto largely employed Chinamen also. Few other established industries have accumulated any gains.

After all that I have said about Chinamen, I can lay no more claim to consistency than anybody else in British Columbia. They are generally abused, and yet everybody employs them. I have always asserted their good qualities; but I have never in twenty-six years had a Chinaman in my house, an expensive whim that nobody else has indulged in. Still, I have had my opportunities of seeing and hearing, for in all that time, I do not think I ever knew a family that did not employ at least one Chinaman.

17 and 18. See answer to 15.

19. The combination which it is intended to suggest would be, I suppose, that the legislature should forbid such arrivals of Chinamen, and that the white population should "" boycott "" those remaining here; or else that the legislature should decree their expulsion. But this would not suffice. It would in addition be necessary that the employers should raise the rate of wages, sufficiently to induce an equivalent influx of new white labor to replace the expelled or boycotted Mongolians: the present rates, $2 per day, for unskilled labor being barely sufficient to attract or retain the whites already here. It may be doubted whether employers would or could, voluntarily and unaided, adhere to this part of the combination. The ordinary class of unskilled labor offered in the market here(and the same is the experience of other colonies) is very unsatisfactory, and the existing tariff has reached perhaps the utmost limit at which employers can continue to exist. Therefore, lest the ""combined effort "" should fail, it would be necessary that a minimum rate, say of $5 per day (which would probably suffice to attract additional white labor) should be fixed by law. But it would take 6,000 new whites to do the work of the expelled Mongolians. In order to supply these with places, it would be further necessary to enact that each person in the employing class must employ from five to fifty of the new comers, at the improved rates. Only one more ordinance would then be required in order to bring the "" combined effort "" into full effect, viz., to make provision for supplying employers out of the public purse with funds to meet this drain on their resources. It is unnecessary to speculate upon the development thus accruing to the material resources of the colony.

20. I never heard of any person, white, black, or yellow, who had labor- British Columbia. to sell that was worth buying, who could not in this province find a ready employer. But in order to get remunerative employment here or anywhere else in the world, a man must be able to do remunerative work. And the misery is, that many men who profess to be willing to turn their hands to anything know nothing to which they can usefully turn their hands. Handicrafts require teaching and practice, and they have never learned. The normal rates of wages are five shillings for Chinamen, and in Victoria eight shillings for white men. Below that rate no white man, even if penniless and hungry, is willing to engage upon any work or service whatever. Skilled artisans, carpenters, masons, blacksmiths ask from twelve to twenty shillings a day. Board is advertised at many hotels at sixteen shillings a week : so I suppose eight shillings a day is remunerative to the workman within the meaning of this question. A miner was recently pointed out to me at Nanaimo in the employ of the Vancouver Coal Company, an ordinary hewer and sinker, who has been in the employ of the company and its predecessors at the current wages of the day for the last thirty years. He has brought up and educated respectably a large family of sons and daughters, all of whom are most respectably married or self-supporting now. He has had no pecuniary aid whatever but his wages, and I was told that he has been able to lay by as a provision for old age (but he is still at regular work) the sum of between $30,000 and $40,000. This, I imagine, may be taken to be a reasonable provision for old age, within the meaning of the question. He has never drank, nor gambled, nor dressed his wife and daughters in silks and satins; he has enjoyed good health and freedom from accident. It is undeniable that every miner in Nanaimo, in proportion to his length of service, has had an equal opportunity of providing against old age, and such workmen would always be welcomed by employers. Of course, when a worker is unable to give to his employer the value of his wages, perhaps not the value of his board, no employer can stand that long, as already pointed out in answer 16.

21. I think it has had a very material effect indeed. For instance, since the beginning of the present year, three thousand souls, as I was informed, have been located in one limited district alone, on the south side of Fraser River, the opposite side to the railway. That is including wives and children.

22. I cannot believe that it has; on the contrary, as the presence of Chinamen has enabled some small capital to be accumulated, they must have augmented the wages fund in the province: i. e., the loose capital seeking to increase itself by the employment of reproductive labor.

I do not believe that any single European in the province would employ a Chinaman about any undertaking if he could procure an European, irrespective of wages, unless, of course, the European demanded wages which precluded all profit on the undertaking. Chinamen are employed not so much because their normal money tariff is lower than the whites and yet not much lower; many Chinamen get $30, and some even $35 and $40, per month-as because they are, as a rule, more sober, steady, docile and industrious. Their language is the great stumbling-block. With very few exceptions, indeed, I never met a Chinaman whom I could understand, beyond the commonest wants, or by whom I could feel any certainty that I was understood, even for an ordinary message. Yet I have often feared that I should be compelled to fall into the universal practice and take Chinese servants into my house-which I have never yet done. I have, indeed, been compelled to employ them indirectly; for there are things that white people simply refuse to do at all, e.g., wash and hew stove-wood.

I append a published list of railway labor rates for whites. The corporation of Victoria employ a good many about the streets; their tariff rates is, I believe, $2 per day; and the work seems by no means to call for over exertion. This table may also be applied to answer 20:

23. I have never personally observed any effect by the Chinese upon the morals of the white people. The latter have occasionally been induced by race- prejudice to indulge in acts of violence ; but it would be too much to say from thence that the Chinaman had corrupted his cowardly assailants. One Chinaman, last year, pleaded guilty to an indictment for indecent assault on two girls of ten or eleven and twelve or thirteen years. I am not sure that he quite understood the effect of his plea, nor am I at all sure that a jury would have convicted a white man on the evidence in the depositions; but I felt sure he had acted abominably, whether tempter or tempted, though I don't think it was he who had corrupted the childrens' morals in the least. However that is the only case I remember in which it could be alleged that a Chinaman had had any evil effect upon the morals of the whites, a matter upon which they can have but very little influence, either for good or evil. Whites who have evil communications with Chinese must themselves be lamentably depraved beforehand; and so, I should be disposed to say, immoral Chinese are not only not more injurious, but they are quite innocuous to the morals of the whites, in comparison with white people of similar or allied habits.

24 and 25. I have seen unmistakable prostitutes in the Chinese quarter of Victoria. But I never noticed any indecent words or gestures, nor anything comparable to what used to be seen any night in Holborn or the Strand; and, from all I have seen and heard, I should say that they do not flaunt their vice and depravity at all. Many will say that they are none the better for that, that Naples, and Paris, and Brussels are worse than London, though the latter displays her vice infinitely more openly. Drunken whites, I am sorry to say, are often to be seen in Victoria, by night or by day; but I do not remember ever to have seen a Chinaman under the influence of liquor. Debauched whites sometimes frequent, I believe, Chinese brothels, as they do Indian brothels. I don't think serious breaches of the peace are proportionately more frequent in Chinese brothels than in those kept by white women. Indian brothels breed the most disturbances; and they are close to the Chinese quarter. This is my notion, but any constable's opinion is far more valuable.

26. As stated in my answer to enquiry ten, I have never seen or heard of more than one case alleged to be leprosy; whether that case was leprosy or not, I cannot say. Of course I have no knowledge of that disease having been communicated to any white person in British Columbia, and I never saw or heard anything which would induce me to believe for an instant that there is the slightest foundation for any such insinuation. It is mere unmeaning abuse.

27. I have omitted to state that Chinamen here are generally divided into two tribes, or clans-there may be more, but I have often had my attention drawn to these two-viz .: ""Canton"" and ""Hong Kong."" Between these clans there is often much jealousy, and sometimes ill blood. Their dialects are in many respects dissimilar, not only in pronunciation, but to such an extent as to have different names for common things; and they very often do not well understand each other, perhaps not better than a Northumberland farm-laborer would understand one from Essex or Dorsetshire. When a breach of the peace occurs among Chinamen, the culprits are generally Canton versus Hong Kong; and when these come into court, either in criminal or civil cases, it is common to allow each side to have an interpreter; as well to watch that the evidence is truly interpreted as also to explain it to their respective clients.

Owing partly to this, and partly also to their unintelligibility to whites, and vice versa, it is usual when twenty or thirty hands are engaged, e. g., at a cannery, not to make the contract with each workman separately, but with some one Chinaman who has learned some English, leaving him to sub-contract with the men; and he being the sole medium of communication between them and the owner of the cannery, this arrangement, though unavoidable, necessarily leaves the men a good deal at the mercy of this foreman. Sometimes this takes place on a much larger scale, and a Chinese merchant here will contract for a whole cargo of Chinamen, fresh from China, whom he engages to provide with employment, and then drafts them out to different employers here, for roads, canneries, etc. All wages are paid to him, and he retains a portion from each workman as his fee. These arrangements, I believe, give rise to the assertion that the whole cargo imported are the slaves of the importer.

Another circumstance has probably induced a similar conclusion. Their laws and customs of marriage and divorce, as in all non-Christian nations, are widely different from ours. They are much more simple and arbitrary. A wife is usually purchased in a very direct way, without any of the circumlocution which too often veils similar transactions among whites. Divorces are effected by mere expressions of the will. A miner who feels no shame in purchasing the possession of a female for a single night for $20, is scandalized when a Chinaman pays $500 for the possession of a female for six months, or until they disagree. No disgust is felt by Europeans when parents make it a sine qua non on consenting to their daughters' marriage that the husband shall settle ten or twenty thousand dollars upon her; but it is infamous if a Chinaman purchases the consent of parents or guardians for one thousand dollars. It is evidence that the female is a mere slave; and that opinion is conclusively established when the husband, after the fashion of his people, hands her over to a second husband for a similar amount. The woman is a slave sold into prostitution, but the Chinese themselves look upon it in a different light. There was a case not long ago in court, before myself, on habeas corpus: A Chinese girl was contracted to marry a man who had offered the guardians five hundred dollars. Another suitor came forward, to whom, at first, it seemed to me, she had no manner of objection, till it turned out that he proposed to take her from her guardians by virtue of the British law of liberty and free choice and without making them any compensation whatever. From that moment she seemed to have taken the strongest distaste to the man who placed no value upon her, and insisted upon going to him who esteemed her worth, at all events, five hundred dollars more than nothing. I apprehend much of what is said about Chinese slavery and prostitution proceeds from imperfect consideration of the difference between Christian and non-Christian marriage; but I only guess this, I know scarcely anything about it.

Another ground on which I have heard it asserted that slavery is general among Chinamen here, is rather, I suspect, a proof of their freedom, or would be so accepted among whites. It is that they demand wages, not such as they would take if left to their own choice, but such as are dictated by certain leaders, who subsist on a percentage of those wages.

I have no doubt but that they have some sort of trades-unions, whose officers and head-centres are supported by subscriptions from the wages received; themselves deciding both on each man's wages and on his subscription. I have no doubt but that compulsion is put on all Chinamen, so that it is very difficult for them to obtain work, if they remain outside this organization. But Messrs. Broadhead, Odger and Arch would indignantly deny that their supporters were slaves.

It is yet further urged against the Chinese, as showing their unfitness to dwell in the land, that they show no respect to our laws, nor to our appointed courts, but refer their differences to private tribunals of their own, whose behests are carried out, irrespective of their conformity with our laws and are never disputed in our courts. As to this I know nothing ; but it seems so probable that it may be assumed to be true. The Chinese, like most other nations with any pretence to civilization, have some methods for referring private disputes to arbitrators chosen by the parties themselves. Such methods are known and practised among all white people; and very extraordinary some of the results are occasionally found to be. That the awards of Chinese arbitrators are always accepted without demur (if the fact be as alleged) would surely be a strong evidence of the equity of the award, and the good sense of the parties in difference; for it is utterly untrue that Chinamen ignore our courts, or treat them with any want of respect. It is as well established as anything touching the feelings and dispositions of these people can be, that they place perfect. confidence in the administration of justice by our officials; and they testify their submission to and acquiescence in the judgments of our courts by every means apparently in their power.

I am very sorry that I can state nothing positive on these last points. I have hitherto had no motive to enquire; and I should view the results of any enquiries with much distrust. Any questions as to their labor associations, their clans, their marriage laws, their immigration contracts, would, I fear, be in general met with suspicion and answered with reluctance. There are very few who could understand the questions; fewer still, probably, who could answer usefully; and to appreciate an answer properly requires a preliminary knowledge in the questioner, which is, exactly what is wanting. Add to this a possible affectation of stupidity, a possible affectation of intelligence, perhaps a reluctance to answer precisely, and a willingness that the enquirer should be balked-apart from the possibility of wilful deceit-all this shows how difficult and uncertain such an enquiry would be here. There is a great conflict of opinion as to. the nature and results of trades-unions at home, after every enquiry possible; how much more difficult would it be to arrive at facts here, where they must necessarily be shrouded behind the impenetrable and irresponsible screen of a Chinese interpreter?

[18th February, 1884.]

WHEREAS the incoming of Chinese to British Columbia largely exceeds that of any other class of immigrant, and the population so introduced are fast becoming superior in number to our own race; are not disposed to be governed by our laws; are dissimilar in habits and occupation from our people; evade the payment of taxes justly due to the Government; are governed by pestilential habits; are useless in instances of emergency; habitually desecrate grave yards by the removal of bodies therefrom; and generally the laws governing the whites are found to be inapplicable to Chinese, and such Chinese are inclined to habits subversive of the comfort and well-being of the community:

And whereas it is expedient to pass special laws for the Government of Chinese:

Therefore, Her Majesty, by and with the advice and consent of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of British Columbia, enacts as follows:—

1. This Act shall be cited as the ""Chinese Regulation Act, 1884.""

2. The term ""Chinese"" wherever used in this Act shall mean any native of the Chinese Empire or its dependencies not born of British parents, and shall include any person of the Chinese race.

3. From and after the passage of this Act there shall be payable and paid by every Chinese in British Columbia, above the age of fourteen years, unto and for the use of Her Majesty, Her heirs and successors, the sum of ten dollars, and thereafter on the 1st day of June in each and every year there shall be likewise payable and paid by such Chinese person a further sum of ten dollars.

4. The Lieutenant-Governor in Council shall immediately upon the passage of this Act, and from time to time thereafter as occasion may require, appoint in each electoral district, one or more person or persons to be called Chinese Collectors, to collect and receive such payments from Chinese, and such Collector or Collectors immediately upon such payment shall issue and deliver to the person paying the same a licence in the form contained in the Schedule hereto, and the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may require from the Collectors so to be appointed such security as he may see fit and may allow them such percentage upon the amount of collections as may seem reasonable and just, and the Lieutenant-Governor in Council may further allow such additional sum by way of expenses as may be necessary and reasonable for the purpose of carrying out the provisions of this Act.

5. Any Chinese who shall be found within the Province not having in his possession a licence issued under the provisions of this Act, lawfully issued to him, shall on conviction thereof forfeit and pay a sum not exceeding forty dollars.

8. Every employer of Chinese shall furnish to the Collector, when requested by him so to do, from time to time, a list of all Chinese in his employ, or indirectly employed by him; but no such statement shall bind the Collector, nor shall excuse him from making due enquiry to ascertain its correctness.

9. In case any employer of Chinese fails to deliver to the Collector the list mentioned in the preceding section, when required so to do, or knowingly states anything falsely therein, such employer shall, on complaint of the Collector and upon conviction before a Justice of the Peace having jurisdiction within the district wherein such employer carries on his business, forfeit and pay a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars for every Chinese in his employ, to be recovered by distress of the goods and chattels of such employer failing to pay the same, or in lieu thereof shall be liable to imprisonment for a period not less than one month and not exceeding two calendar months.

10. The Collector may, by himself or his agent, levy the amount of the licence from any Chinese not being in lawful possession of a licence, with costs, by distress of his goods and chattels, or of any goods and chattels which may be in the possession of the delinquent, or which may be upon or in any premises (whether the goods of the delinquent or not) for the time being in the possession or occupation of such delinquent Chinese, and for the purposes of this section premises shall be deemed to be in the possession or occupation of any Chinese when it can be shewn to the satisfaction of the tribunal having cognizance of the matter—
