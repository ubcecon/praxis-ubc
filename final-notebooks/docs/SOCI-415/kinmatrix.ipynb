        "The KINMATRIX dataset represents families as ego-centric networks of younger adults aged 25 to 35, collecting extensive data about both nuclear and extended kin across ten countries. The data include over 12,000 anchor respondents and more than 252,000 anchor-kin dyads, encompassing a wide range of relatives such as parents, siblings, grandparents, aunts, uncles, cousins, and complex kin (e.g., step- and half-relatives).\n",
        "\n",
        "Anchor respondents refer to the ones directly sampled from. These anchors filled out the survey about their families and kin meaning that they will always be at the center of these family networks. \n",
        "\n",
        "The countries in the dataset are the United Kingdom, Germany, Poland, Italy, Sweeden, Denmark, Finland, Norway, the Netherlands and the USA. \n",

        "\n",
        "We will begin by looking at broader patterns across different countries. This will serve as an introduction into the dataset and will be a foundation for more focused analysis later on. First we import all the necessary Python libraries for data manipulation, network analysis, and visualization. This will allow us to get results for each country. The output of this cell will be a list of countries in the data. \n",

        "The reason for these findings are the sampling methodoly used by the Researchers. In the [Methods Report](https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol51/25/51-25.pdf), we can find that the KINMATRIX researchers explicitly acknowledge that their data shows \"Substantial underrepresentation of lower-educated people in all countries\" and \"No accurate representation of country differences across intermediate and higher education levels\" (8). This is inflating the higher education percentages across the countries in our dataset. Because of the nature of education this bias towards higher education also \"extends also to their parental background\" (14) and further. \n",
        "\n",
        "Another reason for this is bias is the manner in which the data was collected. The key reason is that the researchers did not do random sampling, but rather quota sampling from Dynata access panels which hosted an online survey. This method may lead to the exclusion of people without internet/computer and there was no mobile access. This is a known limitation of web-based, non-probability sampling that affects social surveys and the researchers are aware of it.  \n",
