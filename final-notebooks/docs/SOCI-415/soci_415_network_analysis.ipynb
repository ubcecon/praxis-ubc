        "**Network Analysis** is a set of techniques used to study the structure and dynamics of networks. **Networks** are collections of objects/locations/entities (called _nodes_) connected by relationships (called _edges_). Network analysis has applications in many fields, including sociology, biology, economics, computer science, and more.\n",

        "**Network science in Sociology** Network analysis in sociology is the systematic study of social structure through the mapping and measurement of relationships among individuals, groups, or organizations. It is not a discipline on its own, but rather a methodological and theoretical approach within sociology that helps conceptualize, describe, and model society as interconnected sets of actors linked by specific relationships. Network analysis in sociology is a core tool for understanding how relationships and social structures impact individuals and groups,\n",
