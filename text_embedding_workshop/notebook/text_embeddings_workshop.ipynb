    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview of Historical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "***The 1884 Chinese Regulation Act*** in British Columbia is widely regarded as one of the most notorious discriminatory provincial laws targeting Chinese immigration, it was challenged and ultimately declared unconstitutional in the 1885 case of ***R v. Wing Chong*** by the judge Henry Pering Pellew Crease. The Justice Crease found the legislation to be unconstitutional on economic grounds; infringing on federal authority over immigration, trade, commerce, treaty-making, and taxation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The central figure in the ruling, *Henry Pering Pellew Crease*, came from a wealthy English military family, and possessed a prestigious law background. \n",
    "\n",
    "* His social identity was above-all English, and this was made clear in his politics. \n",
    "* He viewed Canada not as a new society to be built, but as an extension of the british empire. \n",
    "* He displayed mistrust towards Canadians, referring to them as \"North American Chinamen\", afraid that they would \"rule the country and job its offices\" (Tina Loo).\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous years, students expressed interest Crease's opinion on the 1884 Chinese regulation act, given that the regulation act was strongly condemned and ultimately struck down by Crease. However, this seems at odds with Crease's position on Chinese immigrants.\n",
    "\n",
    "This raises an interesting question: **Did Judge Crease strike down the act because of genuine anti-racism concerns, or because he saw the Chinese immigrant labor force as a valuable asset for growing the Canadian economy?**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "* We aim to explore this question by analyzing the language used by Justice Crease in his legal opinions and writings related to Chinese immigrants through **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** approaches. By examining the text, we hope to uncover insights into his stance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The workshop is also to demonstrate how historians can use computational tools to *help* them answer such a research question, by showing each step in the research process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the end, we will be able to transform the text documents into something more intuitive and visually appealing, such as a 2D UMAP projection of the legal text embeddings by sentences. This can possibly help historians to better interpret the relationship between different texts.\n",

    "#### The Problem: Legal Text Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Legal text analysis is itself a complex task, as legal documents are often lengthy, dense, formal, and filled with specialized terminology. They are also often written in neutral or passive voice, making it difficult to discern the author's personal opinions or biases, it poses unique challenges for historians and legal scholars alike, which also challenged the usual methods of natural language processing (NLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Mining insights from such texts requires sophisticated techniques to extract meaningful information and identify patterns. We need the technique to be able to:\n",
    "* **Understand legal vocabulary**: Legal texts often contain specialized terminology and complex sentence structures, the technique should be able to handle legal jargon and formal language.\n",
    "* **Identify contextual semantics**: Legal texts often involve nuanced meanings and interpretations, so the technique should be able to capture the context and semantics of legal language.\n",
    "* **Handle ambiguity**: Legal texts can be ambiguous, with multiple interpretations possible, the technique should be able to handle ambiguity and provide insights into different interpretations.\n",
    "* **Extract relevant topics**: Legal texts often cover multiple topics and issues, the technique should be able to extract relevant topics and themes from the text.\n",
    "* **Analyze sentiment**: Legal texts can convey different sentiments, such as positive, negative, or neutral, the technique should be able to analyze sentiment and provide insights into the author's tone and attitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we will explore how to address these challenges using a comparison approach, that is, while we focus on the text of Justice Crease, we will compare it with other legal texts from the same period to gain a better understanding of the language used in legal documents at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first subject we will use for comparison is the ***1884 Chinese Regulation Act***, which was the law that Crease struck down. The second subject we will use for comparison is **Justice Matthew Baillie Begbie**, who testified alongside Crease in the 1884 Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unlike Crease, historical accounts describe Begbie as protective of marginalized peoples, particularly Indigenous communities and Chinese immigrants.\n",
    "* Similar to what Crease did to the Chinese Regulation Act, Begbie struck down discriminatory municipal by-laws in Victoria that targeted Chinese-owned businesses in the 1888 case of ***R v. Victoria***.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use machine learning techniques, specifically text embeddings, to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compile **a corpus of legal cases and commission reports** authored by contemporary judges concerning Chinese immigrants.\n",
    "2. Apply **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** to the reports in order to convert them to a machine-readable format. \n",
    "3. Examine **keywords** in the texts, to compare the positions of different justices and regulations.\n",
    "4. Use **machine learning** to assess the relative emphasis on economic versus social justice concerns.\n",
    "5. Use **sentiment analysis** to evaluate the tone of the documents, focusing on whether they reflect positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, and compare the sentiments of writings by different authors to identify patterns.\n",
    "6. Use **zero-shot classification** to evaluate whether the documents reflect pro-discrimination, neutral, or anti-discrimination positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach demonstrates different techniques historians can use to identify patterns in documents for analysis."

    "#### Data Collection and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to use 10 digitalized texts, they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Legal Documents that address Chinese immigration in BC during the period: \n",
    "    - *R v. Wing Chong* \n",
    "    - *Wong Hoy Woon v. Duncan* \n",
    "    - *R v. Mee Wah, R v. Victoria* \n",
    "    - *Chinese Regulation Act, 1884*\n",
    "- Reports authored by Crease and Begbie for the Royal Commission that show the judges' personal perspectives. \n",
    "- The remaining documents enrich our corpus for analysis and supplement our study.\n",
    "\n",
    "A big issue with working with historical texts is the format they're stored in: usually scans of varying quality from physical books, articles, etc. However, these are not machine-readable file formats (e.g., text files), so our first step will be using **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** to convert the scanned images into machine-readable text. We chose this approach because: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is a common technique for digitizing printed texts that is already widely used in legal case archives such as the CanLii database, and \n",
    "2. There are many OCR tools available that vary in cost, effectiveness, and ease of use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a brief overview of early and modern OCR techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Early OCR (Pattern Matching):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Compared each character image to a library of fonts and shapes.\n",
    "    - Worked well for clean, printed text.\n",
    "    - Struggled with handwriting, unusual fonts, or degraded scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modern OCR (Intelligent Recognition):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Uses AI to \"read\" text more like a human.\n",
    "    - Analyzes shapes, context, and layout.\n",
    "    - Handles messy, handwritten, or complex documents much better.\n",
    "\n",
    "After testing several tools, we found that modern, AI-based OCR methods produced the most accurate results for our historical documents."

    "### How Computers Interpret Text?\n",
    "\n",
    "While computers can process text swiftly, they do not \"understand\" it in the human sense. Instead, they build mathematical models of language from statistical patterns and structural regularities. These models produce symbolic and continuous representations of words and passages that allow downstream algorithms to detect topics, relationships, and affective signals. However, these representations remain proxies for meaning rather than literal comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process typically involves a sequence of steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenization**: Breaking text into analyzable units (words, subwords, or sentences). \n",
    "2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing text (lowercasing, removing OCR noise, handling archaic spelling). \n",
    "3. **Vectorization**: Converting tokens or texts into numerical vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Simple count-based approaches (TF-IDF) capture term importance across documents. \n",
    "    - Modern contextual methods (BERT, Legal‑BERT) produce dense embeddings that capture usage-dependent semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Modeling and Comparison**: Applying algorithms to those vectors. Examples include cosine similarity for semantic closeness, UMAP for visualization, and zero‑shot classification.\n",
    "5. **Aggregation and Interpretation**: Aggregating sentence- or snippet-level outputs to produce document- or author-level summaries (mean stance vectors, topic distributions), followed by careful human interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this is helpful for social science and humanities research:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Enables analysis of large corpora beyond human reading capacity.\n",
    "- **Pattern Discovery**: Uncovers latent structures and relationships not easily seen by humans.\n",
    "- **Quantification**: Provides numerical measures of abstract concepts (e.g., sentiment, stance).\n",
    "- **Reproducibility**: Offers systematic, repeatable methods for text analysis."

    "#### Count Approach: TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)** is a statistical measure that evaluates the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). It is one of the earliest and most widely used methods for text analysis. It is essentially a count-based approach that quantifies the importance of words in a document based on their frequency and distribution across multiple documents. TF-IDF works by calculating two components:\n",
    "1. **Term Frequency (TF)**: Measures how frequently a term appears in a document.\n",
    "2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: Measures how important a term is across the entire corpus, by considering how many documents contain the term.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purpose, we can use TF-IDF to identify the most important words in each document, which can help us understand the key themes and topics discussed in the text. More details on what we are going to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Regroup the text data into 5 groups:\n",
    "    - All writings\n",
    "    - Crease's writings\n",
    "    - Begbie's writings\n",
    "    - Chinese Regulation Act\n",
    "    - Other documents\n",
    "2. For each group, we will: \n",
    "    - Create a TF-IDF vectorizer to convert the text into numerical vectors.\n",
    "    - Remove common filler words (\"the\", \"and\", etc.).\n",
    "    - Calculate the TF-IDF scores for each word in the documents.\n",
    "    - Identify the most important words based on their TF-IDF scores.\n",
    "3. The most frequent remaining words can reveal the main topics of each case."

    "#### Embedding Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "With the advancement of machine learning, **text embeddings** emerged as a more powerful technique for text analysis. It represents words or phrases as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space, capturing semantic relationships between them. This allows for more nuanced understanding of text, enabling tasks like similarity measurement, clustering, and classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several popular text embedding models, including:\n",
    "- **Word2Vec**: A neural network-based model that learns word embeddings by predicting context words given a target word (or vice versa).\n",
    "- **GloVe**: A global vector representation model that learns word embeddings by factorizing the word co-occurrence matrix.\n",
    "- **FastText**: An extension of Word2Vec that represents words as bags of character n-grams, allowing it to handle out-of-vocabulary words and capture subword information.\n",
    "- **BERT**: A transformer-based model that generates contextualized embeddings by considering the entire sentence context, allowing it to capture word meanings based on their surrounding words.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we will use a BERT-based model to generate text embeddings for our corpus. [nlpaueb/legal-bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/nlpaueb/legal-bert-base-uncased) is a BERT model pre-trained on English legal texts, including legislation, law cases, and contracts. It is designed to capture the legal language and semantics, making it suitable for our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we must note that the model is not perfect and may still have limitations in understanding the nuances of legal language, especially in historical texts. "

    "### Word Embeddings\n",
    "#### Creating Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "While the model itself has the ability to generate word embeddings that capture the semantic meaning of words, we still need to design our own strategy to extract these meanings from our corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Load LEGAL-BERT model and tokenizer.\n",
    "- Tokenize sentences into smaller subword units using a tokenizer.\n",
    "- Process each tokenized sentence through the model to extract hidden layer representations.\n",
    "- Combine subword embeddings to form a single vector for each word by averaging the embeddings of its subword components.\n",
    "- Aggregate embeddings for repeated words across sentences by averaging their vectors.\n",
    "- Return a dictionary mapping each word to its mean embedding, capturing its semantic meaning in the context of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, we are not only able to generate word embeddings with contextual meanings over the whole corpus, but also be able to aggregate our corpus into different groups, and generate contextualized word embeddings for each group."

    "Another important aspect of word embeddings is the ability to measure the similarity between words based on their embeddings. This can be done using cosine similarity, which calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors in the embedding space. The cosine similarity ranges from 0 to 1, where:\n",

    "This allows us to identify related words and concepts based on their embeddings, enabling us to explore the semantic relationships between words in our corpus. And more importantly, it doesn't only allows us to measure the similarity between words, but also allows us to measure the similarity between sentences, paragraphs, and even entire documents, as long as they are represented as vectors in the same embedding space.\n",

    "In comparison to generating word embeddings, modeling stance of each text is more challenging, as it requires us to capture the author's position on a specific issue or topic. Oftentimes, the stance is not explicitly stated in the text, but rather implied through the language used. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is not a universal optimum for stance modeling, as it depends on the specific context and the author's perspective. However, we can use a combination of techniques to create focused embeddings that capture the stance of each text. The strategy we used is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tokenize the text into smaller units and identify the positions of specific keywords or phrases that are relevant to the stance being analyzed.\n",
    "2. For each occurrence of the keywords, extract a surrounding \"window\" of text to capture the context in which the keywords are used.\n",
    "3. Represent the text in the window as numerical vectors using a pre-trained language model, which encodes the meaning of the words and their relationships.\n",
    "4. Combine the vectors within each window using a pooling method (e.g., averaging or selecting the maximum value) to create a single representation for the context around the keyword.\n",
    "5. If multiple occurrences of the keywords are found, average their representations to create a unified vector that captures the overall stance in the text.\n",
    "6. If no keywords are found, use a fallback representation based on the overall text.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach thus allows us to create focused embeddings that capture the stance of each text focusing on specific keywords or phrases. The sentence is used as the basic unit of analysis here, but larger chunks of text can also be used if needed. \n",

    "In the TF-IDF analysis, we observed that the word \"Chinese\" was a prominent term across all groups, indicating its centrality to the discussions in all texts. Following the word \"Chinese\", we also noticed that \"labor\", \"white\", \"legislation\", and \"taxation\" were all significant terms reflected in all texts. This make us wonder: **How do these topics relate to each other, and how do they align with the stances of different authors?**\n",

    "In natural language processing, **topic modeling** is a technique used to identify and extract topics from a collection of documents. It involves analyzing the words and phrases in the text to identify patterns and themes that can be grouped together into topics. Oftentimes, topic modeling are performed using unsupervised learning algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). However, these methods may not be suitable for our corpus, as they require a large amount of text data and may not capture the nuances of legal language.\n",

    "2. **Calculate Cosine Similarity**: For each key term, we will calculate its cosine similarity with other words in the same group to identify related terms. This will help us understand how the key terms are used in different contexts and how they relate to other concepts.\n",
    "3. **Aggregate Related Terms**: We will aggregate the related terms for each key term to form a topic. This will allow us to identify the main topics discussed in each group and how they align with the stances of different authors.\n",
    "4. **Analyze Topic Alignment**: We will analyze the alignment of the identified topics with the stances of different authors. This will help us understand how the topics reflect the authors' positions on the issue of Chinese immigrants.\n",

    "Another powerful technique for text analysis is **zero-shot classification**, which allows us to classify text into predefined categories without requiring labeled training data, with the help of large language models (LLMs). This approach is particularly useful when we have a limited amount of labeled data or when the categories are not well-defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to classifying text into specific categories, zero-shot classification can also be used to evaluate the stance of a text towards a particular issue or topic by **calculating the probability of the text belonging to each category**, the calculated probabilities will sum to 1 and they can be interpreted as the model's confidence in each category. In this workshop, we mainly focus on the second aspect, which allows us to assess the stance of each text. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Hugging Face Transformers library to implement zero-shot classification using a pre-trained model **facebook/bart-large-mnli**. The model is trained on the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI) dataset, which contains pairs of sentences labeled with their relationship (pros, cons, or neutral). This allows the model to learn how to classify text based on its semantic meaning and context, which is particularly useful for our analysis of historical texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key steps in our zero-shot classification process are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the zero-shot pipeline**: We create a zero-shot classification pipeline using the pre-trained model and tokenizer from Hugging Face Transformers, and specify a hypothesis template \"This snippet of a legal text {}\" that will be used to generate hypotheses for classification.\n",
    "2. **Define the candidate labels**: We define a set of candidate labels that represent the stance categories we want to classify the text into, which correspond to the basic stance categories we are interested in, such as \"pro\", \"neutral\" or \"cons\" the equal rights of Chinese immigrants.\n",
    "3. **Classify the text**: We apply the zero-shot classification pipeline to each text in our corpus, generating a probability distribution over the candidate labels for each text.\n",
    "4. **Investigate the results**: We analyze the classification results to identify the stance of each text, focusing on the highest probability label for each text. We also calculate the average probability for each candidate label across all texts to compare the overall stance of different authors and documents."

    "To ensure that the zero-shot classification results are meaningful, we carefully treat the candidate labels as prompts that guide the model's understanding of the stance categories. This allows us to leverage the model's ability to generalize and adapt to new tasks without requiring extensive retraining or fine-tuning. Here, we will use the following candidate labels:\n",
    "- Pro: \"This snippet of a legal text advocates for equal legal treatment of Chinese immigrants compared to white or European settlers, opposing racial discrimination\"\n",
    "- Neutral: \"This snippet of a legal text describes the status or treatment of Chinese immigrants without expressing support or opposition to racial inequality\"\n",

    "However, we must note that this is also a major limitation of the zero-shot classification approach, as it relies on the quality and relevance of the candidate labels to the text being classified. If the labels are not well-defined or do not accurately reflect the stance categories, the classification results may be misleading or inaccurate. This is particularly important when working with historical texts, where the language and context may differ significantly from modern usage. Therefore, it is essential to carefully select and define the candidate labels to ensure that they accurately reflect the stance categories we are interested in."

In other words, every Chinese is guilty until proved innocent—a provision which fills one conversant with subjects with alarm; for if such a law can be tolerated as against Chinese, the precedent is set, and in time of any popular outcry can easily be acted on for putting any other foreigners or even special classes among ourselves, as coloured people, or French, Italians, Americans, or Germans, under equally the same law. That certainly is interfering with aliens. The proposition that it is a Provincial tax for revenue purposes, supposing it to be so intended under the provisions of the Act, is so manifestly calculated to defeat that object, by diminishing the numbers of the members of the persons to be affected by it, that it is difficult to regard it in that light, or in any other light than an indirect mode of getting rid of persons whom it affects out of the country.\n",
