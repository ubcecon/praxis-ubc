    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Overview of Historical Background\n",
    "\n",
    "***The 1884 Chinese Regulation Act*** in British Columbia is widely regarded as one of the most notorious discriminatory provincial laws targeting Chinese immigration, it was challenged and ultimately declared unconstitutional in the 1885 case of ***R v. Wing Chong*** by the judge Henry Pering Pellew Crease. The Justice Crease found the legislation to be unconstitutional on economic grounds; infringing on federal authority over immigration, trade, commerce, treaty-making, and taxation. \n",
    "\n",
    "The central figure in the ruling, *Henry Pering Pellew Crease*, came from a wealthy English military family, and possessed a prestigious law background. \n",
    "\n",
    "* His social identity was above-all English, and this was made clear in his politics. \n",
    "* He viewed Canada not as a new society to be built, but as an extension of the british empire. \n",
    "* He displayed mistrust towards Canadians, referring to them as \"North American Chinamen\", afraid that they would \"rule the country and job its offices\" (Tina Loo).\n",
    "\n",
    "In previous years, students expressed interest Crease's opinion on the 1884 Chinese regulation act, given that the regulation act was strongly condemned and ultimately struck down by Crease. However, this seems at odds with Crease's position on Chinese immigrants.\n",
    "\n",
    "This raises an interesting question: **Did Judge Crease strike down the act because of genuine anti-racism concerns, or because he saw the Chinese immigrant labor force as a valuable asset for growing the Canadian economy?**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "* We aim to explore this question by analyzing the language used by Justice Crease in his legal opinions and writings related to Chinese immigrants through **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** approaches. By examining the text, we hope to uncover insights into his stance.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The workshop is also to demonstrate how historians can use computational tools to *help* them answer such a research question, by showing each step in the research process.\n",
    "\n",
    "* In the end, we will be able to transform the text documents into something more intuitive and visually appealing, such as a 2D UMAP projection of the legal text embeddings by sentences. This can possibly help historians to better interpret the relationship between different texts.\n",

    "#### The Problem: Legal Text Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "Legal text analysis is itself a complex task, as legal documents are often lengthy, dense, formal, and filled with specialized terminology. They are also often written in neutral or passive voice, making it difficult to discern the author's personal opinions or biases, it poses unique challenges for historians and legal scholars alike, which also challenged the usual methods of natural language processing (NLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Mining insights from such texts requires sophisticated techniques to extract meaningful information and identify patterns. We need the technique to be able to:\n",
    "* **Understand legal vocabulary**: Legal texts often contain specialized terminology and complex sentence structures, the technique should be able to handle legal jargon and formal language.\n",
    "* **Identify contextual semantics**: Legal texts often involve nuanced meanings and interpretations, so the technique should be able to capture the context and semantics of legal language.\n",
    "* **Handle ambiguity**: Legal texts can be ambiguous, with multiple interpretations possible, the technique should be able to handle ambiguity and provide insights into different interpretations.\n",
    "* **Extract relevant topics**: Legal texts often cover multiple topics and issues, the technique should be able to extract relevant topics and themes from the text.\n",
    "* **Analyze sentiment**: Legal texts can convey different sentiments, such as positive, negative, or neutral, the technique should be able to analyze sentiment and provide insights into the author's tone and attitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Research Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we will explore how to address these challenges using a comparison approach, that is, while we focus on the text of Justice Crease, we will compare it with other legal texts from the same period to gain a better understanding of the language used in legal documents at that time.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first subject we will use for comparison is the ***1884 Chinese Regulation Act***, which was the law that Crease struck down. The second subject we will use for comparison is **Justice Matthew Baillie Begbie**, who testified alongside Crease in the 1884 Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Unlike Crease, historical accounts describe Begbie as protective of marginalized peoples, particularly Indigenous communities and Chinese immigrants.\n",
    "* Similar to what Crease did to the Chinese Regulation Act, Begbie struck down discriminatory municipal by-laws in Victoria that targeted Chinese-owned businesses in the 1888 case of ***R v. Victoria***.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use machine learning techniques, specifically text embeddings, to do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Compile **a corpus of legal cases and commission reports** authored by contemporary judges concerning Chinese immigrants.\n",
    "2. Apply **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** to the reports in order to convert them to a machine-readable format. \n",
    "3. Examine **keywords** in the texts, to compare the positions of different justices and regulations.\n",
    "4. Use **machine learning** to assess the relative emphasis on economic versus social justice concerns.\n",
    "5. Use **sentiment analysis** to evaluate the tone of the documents, focusing on whether they reflect positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, and compare the sentiments of writings by different authors to identify patterns.\n",
    "6. Use **zero-shot classification** to evaluate whether the documents reflect pro-discrimination, neutral, or anti-discrimination positions.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach demonstrates different techniques historians can use to identify patterns in documents for analysis."

    "#### Data Collection and Preprocessing\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to use 10 digitalized texts, they are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Legal Documents that address Chinese immigration in BC during the period: \n",
    "    - *R v. Wing Chong* \n",
    "    - *Wong Hoy Woon v. Duncan* \n",
    "    - *R v. Mee Wah, R v. Victoria* \n",
    "    - *Chinese Regulation Act, 1884*\n",
    "- Reports authored by Crease and Begbie for the Royal Commission that show the judges' personal perspectives. \n",
    "- The remaining documents enrich our corpus for analysis and supplement our study.\n",
    "\n",
    "A big issue with working with historical texts is the format they're stored in: usually scans of varying quality from physical books, articles, etc. However, these are not machine-readable file formats (e.g., text files), so our first step will be using **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** to convert the scanned images into machine-readable text. We chose this approach because: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. It is a common technique for digitizing printed texts that is already widely used in legal case archives such as the CanLii database, and \n",
    "2. There are many OCR tools available that vary in cost, effectiveness, and ease of use. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a brief overview of early and modern OCR techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Early OCR (Pattern Matching):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Compared each character image to a library of fonts and shapes.\n",
    "    - Worked well for clean, printed text.\n",
    "    - Struggled with handwriting, unusual fonts, or degraded scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Modern OCR (Intelligent Recognition):**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Uses AI to \"read\" text more like a human.\n",
    "    - Analyzes shapes, context, and layout.\n",
    "    - Handles messy, handwritten, or complex documents much better.\n",
    "\n",
    "After testing several tools, we found that modern, AI-based OCR methods produced the most accurate results for our historical documents."

    "### How Computers Interpret Text?\n",
    "\n",
    "While computers can process text swiftly, they do not \"understand\" it in the human sense. Instead, they build mathematical models of language from statistical patterns and structural regularities. These models produce symbolic and continuous representations of words and passages that allow downstream algorithms to detect topics, relationships, and affective signals. However, these representations remain proxies for meaning rather than literal comprehension.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process typically involves a sequence of steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Tokenization**: Breaking text into analyzable units (words, subwords, or sentences). \n",
    "2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing text (lowercasing, removing OCR noise, handling archaic spelling). \n",
    "3. **Vectorization**: Converting tokens or texts into numerical vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "    - Simple count-based approaches (TF-IDF) capture term importance across documents. \n",
    "    - Modern contextual methods (BERT, Legal‑BERT) produce dense embeddings that capture usage-dependent semantics.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Modeling and Comparison**: Applying algorithms to those vectors. Examples include cosine similarity for semantic closeness, UMAP for visualization, and zero‑shot classification.\n",
    "5. **Aggregation and Interpretation**: Aggregating sentence- or snippet-level outputs to produce document- or author-level summaries (mean stance vectors, topic distributions), followed by careful human interpretation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why this is helpful for social science and humanities research:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Scalability**: Enables analysis of large corpora beyond human reading capacity.\n",
    "- **Pattern Discovery**: Uncovers latent structures and relationships not easily seen by humans.\n",
    "- **Quantification**: Provides numerical measures of abstract concepts (e.g., sentiment, stance).\n",
    "- **Reproducibility**: Offers systematic, repeatable methods for text analysis."

    "#### Count Approach: TF-IDF\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)** is a statistical measure that evaluates the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). It is one of the earliest and most widely used methods for text analysis. It is essentially a count-based approach that quantifies the importance of words in a document based on their frequency and distribution across multiple documents. TF-IDF works by calculating two components:\n",
    "1. **Term Frequency (TF)**: Measures how frequently a term appears in a document.\n",
    "2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: Measures how important a term is across the entire corpus, by considering how many documents contain the term.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our purpose, we can use TF-IDF to identify the most important words in each document, which can help us understand the key themes and topics discussed in the text. More details on what we are going to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Regroup the text data into 5 groups:\n",
    "    - All writings\n",
    "    - Crease's writings\n",
    "    - Begbie's writings\n",
    "    - Chinese Regulation Act\n",
    "    - Other documents\n",
    "2. For each group, we will: \n",
    "    - Create a TF-IDF vectorizer to convert the text into numerical vectors.\n",
    "    - Remove common filler words (\"the\", \"and\", etc.).\n",
    "    - Calculate the TF-IDF scores for each word in the documents.\n",
    "    - Identify the most important words based on their TF-IDF scores.\n",
    "3. The most frequent remaining words can reveal the main topics of each case."

    "#### Embedding Approach\n",
    "\n",
    "With the advancement of machine learning, **text embeddings** emerged as a more powerful technique for text analysis. It represents words or phrases as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space, capturing semantic relationships between them. This allows for more nuanced understanding of text, enabling tasks like similarity measurement, clustering, and classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several popular text embedding models, including:\n",
    "- **Word2Vec**: A neural network-based model that learns word embeddings by predicting context words given a target word (or vice versa).\n",
    "- **GloVe**: A global vector representation model that learns word embeddings by factorizing the word co-occurrence matrix.\n",
    "- **FastText**: An extension of Word2Vec that represents words as bags of character n-grams, allowing it to handle out-of-vocabulary words and capture subword information.\n",
    "- **BERT**: A transformer-based model that generates contextualized embeddings by considering the entire sentence context, allowing it to capture word meanings based on their surrounding words.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this workshop, we will use a BERT-based model to generate text embeddings for our corpus. [nlpaueb/legal-bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/nlpaueb/legal-bert-base-uncased) is a BERT model pre-trained on English legal texts, including legislation, law cases, and contracts. It is designed to capture the legal language and semantics, making it suitable for our analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, we must note that the model is not perfect and may still have limitations in understanding the nuances of legal language, especially in historical texts. "

    "### Word Embeddings\n",
    "#### Creating Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "While the model itself has the ability to generate word embeddings that capture the semantic meaning of words, we still need to design our own strategy to extract these meanings from our corpus. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Load LEGAL-BERT model and tokenizer.\n",
    "- Tokenize sentences into smaller subword units using a tokenizer.\n",
    "- Process each tokenized sentence through the model to extract hidden layer representations.\n",
    "- Combine subword embeddings to form a single vector for each word by averaging the embeddings of its subword components.\n",
    "- Aggregate embeddings for repeated words across sentences by averaging their vectors.\n",
    "- Return a dictionary mapping each word to its mean embedding, capturing its semantic meaning in the context of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this way, we are not only able to generate word embeddings with contextual meanings over the whole corpus, but also be able to aggregate our corpus into different groups, and generate contextualized word embeddings for each group."

    "Another important aspect of word embeddings is the ability to measure the similarity between words based on their embeddings. This can be done using cosine similarity, which calculates the cosine of the angle between two vectors in the embedding space. The cosine similarity ranges from 0 to 1, where:\n",

    "This allows us to identify related words and concepts based on their embeddings, enabling us to explore the semantic relationships between words in our corpus. And more importantly, it doesn't only allows us to measure the similarity between words, but also allows us to measure the similarity between sentences, paragraphs, and even entire documents, as long as they are represented as vectors in the same embedding space.\n",

    "In comparison to generating word embeddings, modeling stance of each text is more challenging, as it requires us to capture the author's position on a specific issue or topic. Oftentimes, the stance is not explicitly stated in the text, but rather implied through the language used. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is not a universal optimum for stance modeling, as it depends on the specific context and the author's perspective. However, we can use a combination of techniques to create focused embeddings that capture the stance of each text. The strategy we used is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Tokenize the text into smaller units and identify the positions of specific keywords or phrases that are relevant to the stance being analyzed.\n",
    "2. For each occurrence of the keywords, extract a surrounding \"window\" of text to capture the context in which the keywords are used.\n",
    "3. Represent the text in the window as numerical vectors using a pre-trained language model, which encodes the meaning of the words and their relationships.\n",
    "4. Combine the vectors within each window using a pooling method (e.g., averaging or selecting the maximum value) to create a single representation for the context around the keyword.\n",
    "5. If multiple occurrences of the keywords are found, average their representations to create a unified vector that captures the overall stance in the text.\n",
    "6. If no keywords are found, use a fallback representation based on the overall text.\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach thus allows us to create focused embeddings that capture the stance of each text focusing on specific keywords or phrases. The sentence is used as the basic unit of analysis here, but larger chunks of text can also be used if needed. \n",

    "In the TF-IDF analysis, we observed that the word \"Chinese\" was a prominent term across all groups, indicating its centrality to the discussions in all texts. Following the word \"Chinese\", we also noticed that \"labor\", \"white\", \"legislation\", and \"taxation\" were all significant terms reflected in all texts. This make us wonder: **How do these topics relate to each other, and how do they align with the stances of different authors?**\n",

    "In natural language processing, **topic modeling** is a technique used to identify and extract topics from a collection of documents. It involves analyzing the words and phrases in the text to identify patterns and themes that can be grouped together into topics. Oftentimes, topic modeling are performed using unsupervised learning algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). However, these methods may not be suitable for our corpus, as they require a large amount of text data and may not capture the nuances of legal language.\n",

    "2. **Calculate Cosine Similarity**: For each key term, we will calculate its cosine similarity with other words in the same group to identify related terms. This will help us understand how the key terms are used in different contexts and how they relate to other concepts.\n",
    "3. **Aggregate Related Terms**: We will aggregate the related terms for each key term to form a topic. This will allow us to identify the main topics discussed in each group and how they align with the stances of different authors.\n",
    "4. **Analyze Topic Alignment**: We will analyze the alignment of the identified topics with the stances of different authors. This will help us understand how the topics reflect the authors' positions on the issue of Chinese immigrants.\n",

    "Another powerful technique for text analysis is **zero-shot classification**, which allows us to classify text into predefined categories without requiring labeled training data, with the help of large language models (LLMs). This approach is particularly useful when we have a limited amount of labeled data or when the categories are not well-defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to classifying text into specific categories, zero-shot classification can also be used to evaluate the stance of a text towards a particular issue or topic by **calculating the probability of the text belonging to each category**, the calculated probabilities will sum to 1 and they can be interpreted as the model's confidence in each category. In this workshop, we mainly focus on the second aspect, which allows us to assess the stance of each text. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the Hugging Face Transformers library to implement zero-shot classification using a pre-trained model **facebook/bart-large-mnli**. The model is trained on the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI) dataset, which contains pairs of sentences labeled with their relationship (pros, cons, or neutral). This allows the model to learn how to classify text based on its semantic meaning and context, which is particularly useful for our analysis of historical texts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The key steps in our zero-shot classification process are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Define the zero-shot pipeline**: We create a zero-shot classification pipeline using the pre-trained model and tokenizer from Hugging Face Transformers, and specify a hypothesis template \"This snippet of a legal text {}\" that will be used to generate hypotheses for classification.\n",
    "2. **Define the candidate labels**: We define a set of candidate labels that represent the stance categories we want to classify the text into, which correspond to the basic stance categories we are interested in, such as \"pro\", \"neutral\" or \"cons\" the equal rights of Chinese immigrants.\n",
    "3. **Classify the text**: We apply the zero-shot classification pipeline to each text in our corpus, generating a probability distribution over the candidate labels for each text.\n",
    "4. **Investigate the results**: We analyze the classification results to identify the stance of each text, focusing on the highest probability label for each text. We also calculate the average probability for each candidate label across all texts to compare the overall stance of different authors and documents."

    "To ensure that the zero-shot classification results are meaningful, we carefully treat the candidate labels as prompts that guide the model's understanding of the stance categories. This allows us to leverage the model's ability to generalize and adapt to new tasks without requiring extensive retraining or fine-tuning. Here, we will use the following candidate labels:\n",
    "- Pro: \"This snippet of a legal text advocates for equal legal treatment of Chinese immigrants compared to white or European settlers, opposing racial discrimination\"\n",
    "- Neutral: \"This snippet of a legal text describes the status or treatment of Chinese immigrants without expressing support or opposition to racial inequality\"\n",

    "However, we must note that this is also a major limitation of the zero-shot classification approach, as it relies on the quality and relevance of the candidate labels to the text being classified. If the labels are not well-defined or do not accurately reflect the stance categories, the classification results may be misleading or inaccurate. This is particularly important when working with historical texts, where the language and context may differ significantly from modern usage. Therefore, it is essential to carefully select and define the candidate labels to ensure that they accurately reflect the stance categories we are interested in."

In other words, every Chinese is guilty until proved innocent—a provision which fills one conversant with subjects with alarm; for if such a law can be tolerated as against Chinese, the precedent is set, and in time of any popular outcry can easily be acted on for putting any other foreigners or even special classes among ourselves, as coloured people, or French, Italians, Americans, or Germans, under equally the same law. That certainly is interfering with aliens. The proposition that it is a Provincial tax for revenue purposes, supposing it to be so intended under the provisions of the Act, is so manifestly calculated to defeat that object, by diminishing the numbers of the members of the persons to be affected by it, that it is difficult to regard it in that light, or in any other light than an indirect mode of getting rid of persons whom it affects out of the country.\n",

          "In other words, every Chinese is guilty until<br>proved innocent—a provision which fills one<br>conversant with subjects with alarm; for if such a<br>law can be tolerated as against Chinese, the<br>precedent is set, and in time of any popular<br>outcry can easily be acted on for putting any<br>other foreigners or even special classes among<br>ourselves, as coloured people, or French,<br>Italians, Americans, or Germans, under equally the<br>same law.",

          "It is a great assumption of power on the part of a<br>Province to pass laws, the effect of which must be<br>practically to expel a particular class of aliens<br>from that Province, to say in effect that it will<br>by its legislation impede or prevent that class<br>from being employed in another Province—say the<br>North-west Territory or Manitoba—where railway<br>works may be languishing for want of that very<br>class of labourers, British Columbia being the<br>only sea-board of Canada on the Pacific through<br>which (in face of the restrictive laws of the<br>United States) that class of labourers can enter<br>and pass through; that is, in fact, legislating on<br>all inter-provincial immigration; in other words,<br>such legislation is ultra vires, and so I<br>pronounce it; and adjudge accordingly, and quash<br>the conviction, with costs.",
          "It is an infraction of the existing treaties<br>between the Imperial Government and China.",

          "It is impossible but that such an imposition so<br>enforced, in addition to all the general taxes to<br>which he is subject, should make this country too<br>hot for him to live in; and just in proportion as<br>he is so persecuted out of the country, in that<br>degree does this enactment interfere with trade<br>and commerce and that control over aliens<br>exclusively given to the Dominion.",
          "It is shewn that he did not personally examine a<br>single Chinaman or inquire if he was “an infected<br>or exposed person.”",
          "It was his opinion that every one should be<br>examined who comes from China or from any<br>\"infected port.",
          "Its object, though not apparent on the face of the<br>Act, was to prevent Chinese coming into the<br>Province and drive out those who had already come.",
          "Legislation as to aliens is reserved to the<br>Dominion.",
          "No; an act or default of a stranger, a man whose<br>language he knows not, and for every infraction of<br>the Act by the Chinese under his employ.",
          "Now this assumes, as Dr. Davie assumed, that<br>Hongkong, although a British port and subject to<br>quarantine regulations, was (which includes the<br>time of the steamer's departure) and is a cradle<br>of small pox, and that every ship coming thence to<br>Victoria, especially with Chinese on board, should<br>be subject to the most searching examination, and<br>the drastic treatment I have described.",
          "Now, applying this test to the statute before us,<br>let us see whether and how far its provisions<br>affect, as is alleged, aliens, or trade, or<br>commerce.",
          "Opponents to the Act might as well contend the<br>exclusion of the Chinese from the franchise, and<br>barring them from acquiring lands, was illegal.",
          "So far, I have dealt with the Act on its own<br>merits; but if we consider it in juxtaposition to<br>the Dominion Act recently passed restricting the<br>Chinese throughout all Canada, its illegality<br>becomes transparent; for in passing that Act<br>against the Chinese the Dominion has spoken by the<br>highest authority which it possesses—its own<br>Parliament.",
          "Still both Federal Governments have reserved to<br>themselves the regulation of trade and commerce<br>and naturalization and aliens; so the analogy is<br>so close as to become almost a direct authority.",
          "Sub-section 2 of section 91 gives to the Dominion<br>Parliament exclusively the regulation of “trade<br>and commerce,” and by sub-section 25 that of<br>“naturalization and aliens,” and everything<br>relating to those subjects as affecting the whole<br>Dominion is within the Dominion powers, and no<br>local Legislature can make any statute interfering<br>with either of those subjects.",
          "That certainly is interfering with aliens.",
          "That it interfered with the Dominion powers under<br>the B. N. A. Act over aliens and naturalization.",
          "That it interfered with the Dominion powers under<br>the B. N. A. Act, aliens, and naturalization; 2nd.",
          "That small pox must have been in China on the 19th<br>April last, the date when the Empress left<br>Hongkong, as it was always there.",
          "That the Chinese might be taxed as other<br>residents, but could not be set apart as special<br>objects of the taxation, and be compelled to<br>contribute to the revenue of the State in the<br>character of foreigners.",
          "That there was danger of infection from white<br>passengers, but not the same danger as from<br>Chinamen.\"",
          "The Act is found associated with another Act now<br>disallowed, the express object of which is to<br>prevent the Chinese altogether from coming to this<br>country, and the principle \"noscitur a sociis\" is<br>kept up by the preamble of the present Act, which<br>describes the Chinese in terms which, I venture to<br>think, have never before in any other country<br>found a place in an Act of Parliament.",
          "The Act is so full of provisions that interfere<br>directly with aliens, with trade, and with<br>commerce, that I have no hesitation in pronouncing<br>all such provisions, and among them those under<br>which the appellant in this case has been<br>convicted, to be ultra vires the local<br>legislature, and consequently illegal and void.",
          "The California cases (see The People v. Naglee, 1<br>Cal. 232) decided a differential tax might be<br>imposed on foreign miners; and though a later case<br>(Lin Sing v. Washburn, 20 Cal. 334) had decided a<br>special tax could not be imposed on Chinese, a<br>most celebrated Judge, Mr. Justice Field (since<br>elevated to the Federal bench), dissented, and had<br>pointed out that according to federal decisions<br>the State might impose special taxation on alien<br>residents, provided the impost was not levied<br>against foreigners landing in the country.",
          "The Chinamen had already been examined on board<br>the ship by the Dominion Quarantine Officers and<br>Provincial officers and passed.",
          "The Chinese are chiefly dressed in woollen<br>materials and these harbour infection for weeks<br>and months.",
          "The Dominion under the B. N. A. Act had alone the<br>right of performing in Canada the obligations of<br>Canada as part of the British Empire in respect of<br>treaties, and although Canada might pass laws<br>prohibiting immigration, or having that tendency,<br>the Province could not do so, nor could it pass<br>laws in derogation of treaties.",
          "The action is one nominally rather than really,<br>for damages against Dr. George Duncan, the Health<br>Officer of the City of Victoria, on account of an<br>alleged excess of duty in despatching en masse,<br>without examination or enquiry, a number of<br>Chinamen out to the suspect station at Ross Bay,<br>there to be disinfected and scrubbed.",
          "The aliens in this case being Chinese, the first<br>enquiry must be, what is the object of the Act?",
          "The amount of business transacted by Chinamen in<br>British Columbia, as revealed by the tables in<br>that Chinese Report, is something which a casual<br>observer would have no idea of.",
          "The basis, then, of our enquiry must be: Is this<br>Chinese Regulation Act of 1884—rather the parts of<br>it objected to—within the limit of subjects and<br>area of section 92, or does it exceed those limits<br>in which it is supreme, and interfere with aliens,<br>trade and commerce in such a manner as to encroach<br>on section 91 or any of its sub-sections?",
          "The case was tried before a jury upon the issue<br>whether Hongkong, the last port the steamer left<br>in China, was or not “an infected locality.”",
          "The grounds alleged by the Health Officer for this<br>arbitrary treatment is “that China is an infected<br>locality,” and all persons coming from China and<br>especially in this instance Hongkong, and<br>especially also the natives of China, come from an<br>infected locality, and that he has that authority<br>under the Health By-Law, 1893, which was passed at<br>the time of the small pox panic in Victoria, and,<br>in all he did, was simply doing his duty.",
          "The law did not deal with the conditions under<br>which aliens might acquire rights or become<br>subjects of Her Majesty.",
          "The occasion was the arrival of the Empress of<br>China at the Outer Wharf, which is within the city<br>limits of Victoria, on the 1st day of May, 1894,<br>from China and Hongkong.",
          "The only evidence of Hong Kong being a place<br>infected, etc., was that of a medical man resident<br>in Victoria, who said \"That in China small pox was<br>endemic, because there inoculation was the<br>universal practice.",
          "The palpable object of such a provision, or set of<br>provisions, is to render the employment of Chinese<br>so distasteful and annoying to the employer that<br>he must cease to employ them.",
          "The plaintiff and other Chinamen similarly<br>situated obtained a writ of Habeas Corpus, upon<br>which they were discharged from this custody.",
          "The power asserted in the Act in question (the<br>California Act) is the right of the State to<br>prescribe the terms upon which the Chinese shall<br>be permitted to reside in it, and be so used as to<br>cut off all intercourse between them and the<br>people of the State, and defeat the commercial<br>policy of the nation.",
          "The provisions of the Act I have given somewhat in<br>extenso bear out that view, and the concurrent and<br>previous local legislation bear out the same<br>impression, for on the same day as this Act was<br>passed, another Act was passed, the very object of<br>which was plainly stated to be \"to prevent the<br>immigration\" of Chinese.\"",
          "The reports of the higher California courts are of<br>great authority for us on all Chinese questions,<br>for there have been efforts for years past to<br>restrict Chinese immigration in California, and<br>the matter has been constantly before the superior<br>courts there, and the judges there (if we may take<br>the reports as correct) are more than ordinarily<br>skilled in laying down the law correctly in<br>constitutional points of that nature.",
          "The same provisions that apply to Chinese may be<br>made to apply also to Americans, Frenchmen,<br>Germans, or any other foreigners.",
          "The tax was not to exclude the Chinese — another<br>statute with that object had been disallowed.",
          "The treaties I have quoted between Great Britain<br>and China, binding on the Dominion and on us in<br>British Columbia, secure to the Chinese, just as<br>the treaties between Great Britain and other<br>foreign countries secure to other foreigners, the<br>same rights in regard to the equality of taxation<br>which I have described as being enjoyed by<br>citizens of this country.",
          "The treaties between Great Britain and China,<br>which bind us, have been quoted.",
          "The treaty of 25th August, 1842, *Hertslet*, Vol.<br>6, ratified 26th June, 1843, p. 221, and Lord<br>Elgin's treaty of October, 1860, authenticated<br>copies of which were produced in Court, secure to<br>Chinese coming into British dominions the same<br>\"full security for persons and property as<br>subjects of Her Majesty.\"",
          "The whole Act teems with special provisions which<br>affect not only Chinese, but their employers, with<br>obligations and liabilities as to the conduct of<br>the Chinese in their employ, that no reasonable<br>man would encounter, and run the risk of the penal<br>consequences which the Act hangs over him.",
          "There was danger of infection from white<br>passengers, but not the same danger as from<br>Chinamen.",
          "There were several other diseases to be guarded<br>against from China, e.g., cholera, leprosy, etc.",
          "Thereupon the present action was brought to test<br>if and how far Chinamen are to be treated, when<br>they land on our shores, differently from other<br>foreigners.",
          "What is that but interfering with aliens, trade,<br>and commerce?",

          "Every employé of Chinese labour, whether English,<br>American, or what not, is made liable to severe<br>and incessant liability of a penal kind, for what?",
          "Every person of Chinese origin, whether<br>naturalized in Hong Kong or America, or any other<br>State with which we are at amity, so long as they<br>are of Chinese origin, 14 years of age—every one<br>without distinction—must take out a license.",
          "He considered “China the home of small pox,” and<br>that it was “an infected place”; that, in China,<br>small pox was “endemic,” i.e., always there;<br>because there “inoculation” was the universal<br>practice and was a constant source of danger; that<br>in England and Europe and America, generally,<br>vaccination, of late years, has been the rule.",
          "He does not include Japanese in the same category<br>as Chinese.",
          "He had no opinion to express as to the British<br>possession of Hongkong; but it was a portion of<br>China, where small pox was always, in a sense,<br>\"endemic.\"",
          "He reviewed the legislation against Chinese since<br>confederation, contending it was levelled against<br>a particular race of aliens and, therefore, beyond<br>provincial control, per *Gwynne*, J., in *Citizens<br>Insurance Co. v. Parsons*, 4 S. C. R., at p. 346.",
          "He thought that too close a scrutiny could not be<br>made of Chinese passengers.",
          "Held, that the “Chinese Regulation Act, 1884,” is<br>ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature, on the<br>following grounds:   1.",
          "His duty was, if he considered the Empress of<br>China came from \"an infected locality,\" at once to<br>go on board the suspected vessel and make his<br>examination and inspection on board the vessel (as<br>Section 32 says), \"before any luggage, freight or<br>other thing is landed or allowed to be landed.",
          "However difficult or impossible for any Chinese to<br>find a district collector, if such Chinese is<br>\"found without a license he is liable to a fine of<br>$40.\"",
          "If a man employ a Chinaman who should happen to be<br>delinquent in his tax, and he happens to occupy a<br>cottage or room of his employer, with his master's<br>goods in it, under section 10 they are liable to<br>seizure and sale.",
          "If its object were successful and Chinese driven<br>from the country, the customs dues received from<br>the Chinese would be lost and the benefits of<br>trade relations enjoyed by the merchants would be<br>destroyed.",
          "In another California case, *In re Tiburcio<br>Parrott*, it is laid down that if the apparent<br>object of a statute is under a pretense of the<br>exercise of constitutional powers to drive Chinese<br>away, the end sought to be obtained being<br>unlawful, the statute is void.",
          "In other words, every Chinese is guilty until<br>proved innocent—a provision which fills one<br>conversant with subjects with alarm; for if such a<br>law can be tolerated as against Chinese, the<br>precedent is set, and in time of any popular<br>outcry can easily be acted on for putting any<br>other foreigners or even special classes among<br>ourselves, as coloured people, or French,<br>Italians, Americans, or Germans, under equally the<br>same law.",
          "In the case of the Chinese treaties, they were<br>forced at the point of the bayonet on China, to<br>obtain a right for us to enter China, and in<br>return for a similar permission to us, full<br>permission was given for the Chinese to trade and<br>reside in British dominions everywhere.",
          "In the treaties of 1858 and 1860, made at the<br>solicitation of Great Britain, the Emperor of<br>China was induced to give permission to his<br>subjects to go and trade and reside \"in British<br>Colonies,\" and to enter into \"engagements with<br>British subjects for that purpose.\"",
          "It interfered with aliens as well as trade and<br>commerce, which cannot subsist among nations<br>without personal intercourse, which such an Act<br>(as far as China was concerned) would have a<br>tendency to prohibit.",
          "It is a great assumption of power on the part of a<br>Province to pass laws, the effect of which must be<br>practically to expel a particular class of aliens<br>from that Province, to say in effect that it will<br>by its legislation impede or prevent that class<br>from being employed in another Province—say the<br>North-west Territory or Manitoba—where railway<br>works may be languishing for want of that very<br>class of labourers, British Columbia being the<br>only sea-board of Canada on the Pacific through<br>which (in face of the restrictive laws of the<br>United States) that class of labourers can enter<br>and pass through; that is, in fact, legislating on<br>all inter-provincial immigration; in other words,<br>such legislation is ultra vires, and so I<br>pronounce it; and adjudge accordingly, and quash<br>the conviction, with costs.",
          "It is an infraction of the existing treaties<br>between the Imperial Government and China.",
          "It is enough to add that \"any person,\" no matter<br>whether white or Chinese, imprisoned in respect of<br>any infraction of the provisions of the Act, may<br>be at the will of the executive, subjected even to<br>hard labour.",
          "It is impossible but that such an imposition so<br>enforced, in addition to all the general taxes to<br>which he is subject, should make this country too<br>hot for him to live in; and just in proportion as<br>he is so persecuted out of the country, in that<br>degree does this enactment interfere with trade<br>and commerce and that control over aliens<br>exclusively given to the Dominion.",
          "It is shewn that he did not personally examine a<br>single Chinaman or inquire if he was “an infected<br>or exposed person.”",
          "It was his opinion that every one should be<br>examined who comes from China or from any<br>\"infected port.",
          "Its object, though not apparent on the face of the<br>Act, was to prevent Chinese coming into the<br>Province and drive out those who had already come.",
          "Legislation as to aliens is reserved to the<br>Dominion.",
          "No; an act or default of a stranger, a man whose<br>language he knows not, and for every infraction of<br>the Act by the Chinese under his employ.",
          "Now this assumes, as Dr. Davie assumed, that<br>Hongkong, although a British port and subject to<br>quarantine regulations, was (which includes the<br>time of the steamer's departure) and is a cradle<br>of small pox, and that every ship coming thence to<br>Victoria, especially with Chinese on board, should<br>be subject to the most searching examination, and<br>the drastic treatment I have described.",
          "Now, applying this test to the statute before us,<br>let us see whether and how far its provisions<br>affect, as is alleged, aliens, or trade, or<br>commerce.",
          "Opponents to the Act might as well contend the<br>exclusion of the Chinese from the franchise, and<br>barring them from acquiring lands, was illegal.",
          "So far, I have dealt with the Act on its own<br>merits; but if we consider it in juxtaposition to<br>the Dominion Act recently passed restricting the<br>Chinese throughout all Canada, its illegality<br>becomes transparent; for in passing that Act<br>against the Chinese the Dominion has spoken by the<br>highest authority which it possesses—its own<br>Parliament.",
          "Still both Federal Governments have reserved to<br>themselves the regulation of trade and commerce<br>and naturalization and aliens; so the analogy is<br>so close as to become almost a direct authority.",
          "Sub-section 2 of section 91 gives to the Dominion<br>Parliament exclusively the regulation of “trade<br>and commerce,” and by sub-section 25 that of<br>“naturalization and aliens,” and everything<br>relating to those subjects as affecting the whole<br>Dominion is within the Dominion powers, and no<br>local Legislature can make any statute interfering<br>with either of those subjects.",
          "That certainly is interfering with aliens.",
          "That it interfered with the Dominion powers under<br>the B. N. A. Act over aliens and naturalization.",
          "That it interfered with the Dominion powers under<br>the B. N. A. Act, aliens, and naturalization; 2nd.",
          "That small pox must have been in China on the 19th<br>April last, the date when the Empress left<br>Hongkong, as it was always there.",
          "That the Chinese might be taxed as other<br>residents, but could not be set apart as special<br>objects of the taxation, and be compelled to<br>contribute to the revenue of the State in the<br>character of foreigners.",
          "That there was danger of infection from white<br>passengers, but not the same danger as from<br>Chinamen.\"",
          "The Act is found associated with another Act now<br>disallowed, the express object of which is to<br>prevent the Chinese altogether from coming to this<br>country, and the principle \"noscitur a sociis\" is<br>kept up by the preamble of the present Act, which<br>describes the Chinese in terms which, I venture to<br>think, have never before in any other country<br>found a place in an Act of Parliament.",
          "The Act is so full of provisions that interfere<br>directly with aliens, with trade, and with<br>commerce, that I have no hesitation in pronouncing<br>all such provisions, and among them those under<br>which the appellant in this case has been<br>convicted, to be ultra vires the local<br>legislature, and consequently illegal and void.",
          "The California cases (see The People v. Naglee, 1<br>Cal. 232) decided a differential tax might be<br>imposed on foreign miners; and though a later case<br>(Lin Sing v. Washburn, 20 Cal. 334) had decided a<br>special tax could not be imposed on Chinese, a<br>most celebrated Judge, Mr. Justice Field (since<br>elevated to the Federal bench), dissented, and had<br>pointed out that according to federal decisions<br>the State might impose special taxation on alien<br>residents, provided the impost was not levied<br>against foreigners landing in the country.",
          "The Chinamen had already been examined on board<br>the ship by the Dominion Quarantine Officers and<br>Provincial officers and passed.",
          "The Chinese are chiefly dressed in woollen<br>materials and these harbour infection for weeks<br>and months.",
          "The Dominion under the B. N. A. Act had alone the<br>right of performing in Canada the obligations of<br>Canada as part of the British Empire in respect of<br>treaties, and although Canada might pass laws<br>prohibiting immigration, or having that tendency,<br>the Province could not do so, nor could it pass<br>laws in derogation of treaties.",
          "The action is one nominally rather than really,<br>for damages against Dr. George Duncan, the Health<br>Officer of the City of Victoria, on account of an<br>alleged excess of duty in despatching en masse,<br>without examination or enquiry, a number of<br>Chinamen out to the suspect station at Ross Bay,<br>there to be disinfected and scrubbed.",
          "The aliens in this case being Chinese, the first<br>enquiry must be, what is the object of the Act?",
          "The amount of business transacted by Chinamen in<br>British Columbia, as revealed by the tables in<br>that Chinese Report, is something which a casual<br>observer would have no idea of.",
          "The basis, then, of our enquiry must be: Is this<br>Chinese Regulation Act of 1884—rather the parts of<br>it objected to—within the limit of subjects and<br>area of section 92, or does it exceed those limits<br>in which it is supreme, and interfere with aliens,<br>trade and commerce in such a manner as to encroach<br>on section 91 or any of its sub-sections?",
          "The case was tried before a jury upon the issue<br>whether Hongkong, the last port the steamer left<br>in China, was or not “an infected locality.”",
          "The grounds alleged by the Health Officer for this<br>arbitrary treatment is “that China is an infected<br>locality,” and all persons coming from China and<br>especially in this instance Hongkong, and<br>especially also the natives of China, come from an<br>infected locality, and that he has that authority<br>under the Health By-Law, 1893, which was passed at<br>the time of the small pox panic in Victoria, and,<br>in all he did, was simply doing his duty.",
          "The law did not deal with the conditions under<br>which aliens might acquire rights or become<br>subjects of Her Majesty.",
          "The occasion was the arrival of the Empress of<br>China at the Outer Wharf, which is within the city<br>limits of Victoria, on the 1st day of May, 1894,<br>from China and Hongkong.",
          "The only evidence of Hong Kong being a place<br>infected, etc., was that of a medical man resident<br>in Victoria, who said \"That in China small pox was<br>endemic, because there inoculation was the<br>universal practice.",
          "The palpable object of such a provision, or set of<br>provisions, is to render the employment of Chinese<br>so distasteful and annoying to the employer that<br>he must cease to employ them.",
          "The plaintiff and other Chinamen similarly<br>situated obtained a writ of Habeas Corpus, upon<br>which they were discharged from this custody.",
          "The power asserted in the Act in question (the<br>California Act) is the right of the State to<br>prescribe the terms upon which the Chinese shall<br>be permitted to reside in it, and be so used as to<br>cut off all intercourse between them and the<br>people of the State, and defeat the commercial<br>policy of the nation.",
          "The provisions of the Act I have given somewhat in<br>extenso bear out that view, and the concurrent and<br>previous local legislation bear out the same<br>impression, for on the same day as this Act was<br>passed, another Act was passed, the very object of<br>which was plainly stated to be \"to prevent the<br>immigration\" of Chinese.\"",
          "The reports of the higher California courts are of<br>great authority for us on all Chinese questions,<br>for there have been efforts for years past to<br>restrict Chinese immigration in California, and<br>the matter has been constantly before the superior<br>courts there, and the judges there (if we may take<br>the reports as correct) are more than ordinarily<br>skilled in laying down the law correctly in<br>constitutional points of that nature.",
          "The same provisions that apply to Chinese may be<br>made to apply also to Americans, Frenchmen,<br>Germans, or any other foreigners.",
          "The tax was not to exclude the Chinese — another<br>statute with that object had been disallowed.",
          "The treaties I have quoted between Great Britain<br>and China, binding on the Dominion and on us in<br>British Columbia, secure to the Chinese, just as<br>the treaties between Great Britain and other<br>foreign countries secure to other foreigners, the<br>same rights in regard to the equality of taxation<br>which I have described as being enjoyed by<br>citizens of this country.",
          "The treaties between Great Britain and China,<br>which bind us, have been quoted.",
          "The treaty of 25th August, 1842, *Hertslet*, Vol.<br>6, ratified 26th June, 1843, p. 221, and Lord<br>Elgin's treaty of October, 1860, authenticated<br>copies of which were produced in Court, secure to<br>Chinese coming into British dominions the same<br>\"full security for persons and property as<br>subjects of Her Majesty.\"",
          "The whole Act teems with special provisions which<br>affect not only Chinese, but their employers, with<br>obligations and liabilities as to the conduct of<br>the Chinese in their employ, that no reasonable<br>man would encounter, and run the risk of the penal<br>consequences which the Act hangs over him.",
          "There was danger of infection from white<br>passengers, but not the same danger as from<br>Chinamen.",
          "There were several other diseases to be guarded<br>against from China, e.g., cholera, leprosy, etc.",
          "Thereupon the present action was brought to test<br>if and how far Chinamen are to be treated, when<br>they land on our shores, differently from other<br>foreigners.",
          "What is that but interfering with aliens, trade,<br>and commerce?",

          "And it is roundly alleged by the appellant that<br>this tax is imposed, not with the object of<br>raising a revenue for the City, but with the<br>object of harassing Chinamen, supposed to be the<br>only persons carrying on this industry.",

          "I rather think that the auctioneers would<br>repudiate this alleged similarity of their<br>occupation to that of a Chinese washerman.",
          "I, for my part, cannot arrive at any other<br>conclusion than that it is specially directed<br>against Chinamen because they are Chinamen and for<br>no other Judgment.",

          "In the French colony of Cayenne, the Town Council<br>recently handicapped the superior capacities of<br>the Chinaman by imposing on merchants of that<br>empire an extra tax of $300 per annum, deeming it<br>also expedient to handicap English and German<br>traders by a surtax of $200 on them.",

          "In other words, every Chinese is guilty until<br>proved innocent—a provision which fills one<br>conversant with subjects with alarm; for if such a<br>law can be tolerated as against Chinese, the<br>precedent is set, and in time of any popular<br>outcry can easily be acted on for putting any<br>other foreigners or even special classes among<br>ourselves, as coloured people, or French,<br>Italians, Americans, or Germans, under equally the<br>same law.",

          "It is a great assumption of power on the part of a<br>Province to pass laws, the effect of which must be<br>practically to expel a particular class of aliens<br>from that Province, to say in effect that it will<br>by its legislation impede or prevent that class<br>from being employed in another Province—say the<br>North-west Territory or Manitoba—where railway<br>works may be languishing for want of that very<br>class of labourers, British Columbia being the<br>only sea-board of Canada on the Pacific through<br>which (in face of the restrictive laws of the<br>United States) that class of labourers can enter<br>and pass through; that is, in fact, legislating on<br>all inter-provincial immigration; in other words,<br>such legislation is ultra vires, and so I<br>pronounce it; and adjudge accordingly, and quash<br>the conviction, with costs.",

          "It is impossible but that such an imposition so<br>enforced, in addition to all the general taxes to<br>which he is subject, should make this country too<br>hot for him to live in; and just in proportion as<br>he is so persecuted out of the country, in that<br>degree does this enactment interfere with trade<br>and commerce and that control over aliens<br>exclusively given to the Dominion.",
          "It is shewn that he did not personally examine a<br>single Chinaman or inquire if he was “an infected<br>or exposed person.”",
          "It was his opinion that every one should be<br>examined who comes from China or from any<br>\"infected port.",
          "Its object, though not apparent on the face of the<br>Act, was to prevent Chinese coming into the<br>Province and drive out those who had already come.",
          "Legislation as to aliens is reserved to the<br>Dominion.",
          "No; an act or default of a stranger, a man whose<br>language he knows not, and for every infraction of<br>the Act by the Chinese under his employ.",
          "Now this assumes, as Dr. Davie assumed, that<br>Hongkong, although a British port and subject to<br>quarantine regulations, was (which includes the<br>time of the steamer's departure) and is a cradle<br>of small pox, and that every ship coming thence to<br>Victoria, especially with Chinese on board, should<br>be subject to the most searching examination, and<br>the drastic treatment I have described.",
          "Now, applying this test to the statute before us,<br>let us see whether and how far its provisions<br>affect, as is alleged, aliens, or trade, or<br>commerce.",
          "Opponents to the Act might as well contend the<br>exclusion of the Chinese from the franchise, and<br>barring them from acquiring lands, was illegal.",
          "So far, I have dealt with the Act on its own<br>merits; but if we consider it in juxtaposition to<br>the Dominion Act recently passed restricting the<br>Chinese throughout all Canada, its illegality<br>becomes transparent; for in passing that Act<br>against the Chinese the Dominion has spoken by the<br>highest authority which it possesses—its own<br>Parliament.",
          "Still both Federal Governments have reserved to<br>themselves the regulation of trade and commerce<br>and naturalization and aliens; so the analogy is<br>so close as to become almost a direct authority.",
          "Sub-section 2 of section 91 gives to the Dominion<br>Parliament exclusively the regulation of “trade<br>and commerce,” and by sub-section 25 that of<br>“naturalization and aliens,” and everything<br>relating to those subjects as affecting the whole<br>Dominion is within the Dominion powers, and no<br>local Legislature can make any statute interfering<br>with either of those subjects.",
          "That certainly is interfering with aliens.",
          "That it interfered with the Dominion powers under<br>the B. N. A. Act over aliens and naturalization.",
          "That it interfered with the Dominion powers under<br>the B. N. A. Act, aliens, and naturalization; 2nd.",
          "That small pox must have been in China on the 19th<br>April last, the date when the Empress left<br>Hongkong, as it was always there.",
          "That the Chinese might be taxed as other<br>residents, but could not be set apart as special<br>objects of the taxation, and be compelled to<br>contribute to the revenue of the State in the<br>character of foreigners.",
          "That there was danger of infection from white<br>passengers, but not the same danger as from<br>Chinamen.\"",
          "The Act is found associated with another Act now<br>disallowed, the express object of which is to<br>prevent the Chinese altogether from coming to this<br>country, and the principle \"noscitur a sociis\" is<br>kept up by the preamble of the present Act, which<br>describes the Chinese in terms which, I venture to<br>think, have never before in any other country<br>found a place in an Act of Parliament.",
          "The Act is so full of provisions that interfere<br>directly with aliens, with trade, and with<br>commerce, that I have no hesitation in pronouncing<br>all such provisions, and among them those under<br>which the appellant in this case has been<br>convicted, to be ultra vires the local<br>legislature, and consequently illegal and void.",
          "The California cases (see The People v. Naglee, 1<br>Cal. 232) decided a differential tax might be<br>imposed on foreign miners; and though a later case<br>(Lin Sing v. Washburn, 20 Cal. 334) had decided a<br>special tax could not be imposed on Chinese, a<br>most celebrated Judge, Mr. Justice Field (since<br>elevated to the Federal bench), dissented, and had<br>pointed out that according to federal decisions<br>the State might impose special taxation on alien<br>residents, provided the impost was not levied<br>against foreigners landing in the country.",
          "The Chinamen had already been examined on board<br>the ship by the Dominion Quarantine Officers and<br>Provincial officers and passed.",
          "The Chinese are chiefly dressed in woollen<br>materials and these harbour infection for weeks<br>and months.",
          "The Dominion under the B. N. A. Act had alone the<br>right of performing in Canada the obligations of<br>Canada as part of the British Empire in respect of<br>treaties, and although Canada might pass laws<br>prohibiting immigration, or having that tendency,<br>the Province could not do so, nor could it pass<br>laws in derogation of treaties.",
          "The action is one nominally rather than really,<br>for damages against Dr. George Duncan, the Health<br>Officer of the City of Victoria, on account of an<br>alleged excess of duty in despatching en masse,<br>without examination or enquiry, a number of<br>Chinamen out to the suspect station at Ross Bay,<br>there to be disinfected and scrubbed.",
          "The aliens in this case being Chinese, the first<br>enquiry must be, what is the object of the Act?",
          "The amount of business transacted by Chinamen in<br>British Columbia, as revealed by the tables in<br>that Chinese Report, is something which a casual<br>observer would have no idea of.",
          "The basis, then, of our enquiry must be: Is this<br>Chinese Regulation Act of 1884—rather the parts of<br>it objected to—within the limit of subjects and<br>area of section 92, or does it exceed those limits<br>in which it is supreme, and interfere with aliens,<br>trade and commerce in such a manner as to encroach<br>on section 91 or any of its sub-sections?",
          "The case was tried before a jury upon the issue<br>whether Hongkong, the last port the steamer left<br>in China, was or not “an infected locality.”",
          "The grounds alleged by the Health Officer for this<br>arbitrary treatment is “that China is an infected<br>locality,” and all persons coming from China and<br>especially in this instance Hongkong, and<br>especially also the natives of China, come from an<br>infected locality, and that he has that authority<br>under the Health By-Law, 1893, which was passed at<br>the time of the small pox panic in Victoria, and,<br>in all he did, was simply doing his duty.",
          "The law did not deal with the conditions under<br>which aliens might acquire rights or become<br>subjects of Her Majesty.",
          "The occasion was the arrival of the Empress of<br>China at the Outer Wharf, which is within the city<br>limits of Victoria, on the 1st day of May, 1894,<br>from China and Hongkong.",
          "The only evidence of Hong Kong being a place<br>infected, etc., was that of a medical man resident<br>in Victoria, who said \"That in China small pox was<br>endemic, because there inoculation was the<br>universal practice.",
          "The palpable object of such a provision, or set of<br>provisions, is to render the employment of Chinese<br>so distasteful and annoying to the employer that<br>he must cease to employ them.",
          "The plaintiff and other Chinamen similarly<br>situated obtained a writ of Habeas Corpus, upon<br>which they were discharged from this custody.",
          "The power asserted in the Act in question (the<br>California Act) is the right of the State to<br>prescribe the terms upon which the Chinese shall<br>be permitted to reside in it, and be so used as to<br>cut off all intercourse between them and the<br>people of the State, and defeat the commercial<br>policy of the nation.",
          "The provisions of the Act I have given somewhat in<br>extenso bear out that view, and the concurrent and<br>previous local legislation bear out the same<br>impression, for on the same day as this Act was<br>passed, another Act was passed, the very object of<br>which was plainly stated to be \"to prevent the<br>immigration\" of Chinese.\"",
          "The reports of the higher California courts are of<br>great authority for us on all Chinese questions,<br>for there have been efforts for years past to<br>restrict Chinese immigration in California, and<br>the matter has been constantly before the superior<br>courts there, and the judges there (if we may take<br>the reports as correct) are more than ordinarily<br>skilled in laying down the law correctly in<br>constitutional points of that nature.",
          "The same provisions that apply to Chinese may be<br>made to apply also to Americans, Frenchmen,<br>Germans, or any other foreigners.",
          "The tax was not to exclude the Chinese — another<br>statute with that object had been disallowed.",
          "The treaties I have quoted between Great Britain<br>and China, binding on the Dominion and on us in<br>British Columbia, secure to the Chinese, just as<br>the treaties between Great Britain and other<br>foreign countries secure to other foreigners, the<br>same rights in regard to the equality of taxation<br>which I have described as being enjoyed by<br>citizens of this country.",
          "The treaties between Great Britain and China,<br>which bind us, have been quoted.",
          "The treaty of 25th August, 1842, *Hertslet*, Vol.<br>6, ratified 26th June, 1843, p. 221, and Lord<br>Elgin's treaty of October, 1860, authenticated<br>copies of which were produced in Court, secure to<br>Chinese coming into British dominions the same<br>\"full security for persons and property as<br>subjects of Her Majesty.\"",
          "The whole Act teems with special provisions which<br>affect not only Chinese, but their employers, with<br>obligations and liabilities as to the conduct of<br>the Chinese in their employ, that no reasonable<br>man would encounter, and run the risk of the penal<br>consequences which the Act hangs over him.",
          "There was danger of infection from white<br>passengers, but not the same danger as from<br>Chinamen.",
          "There were several other diseases to be guarded<br>against from China, e.g., cholera, leprosy, etc.",
          "Thereupon the present action was brought to test<br>if and how far Chinamen are to be treated, when<br>they land on our shores, differently from other<br>foreigners.",
          "What is that but interfering with aliens, trade,<br>and commerce?",

          "Every employé of Chinese labour, whether English,<br>American, or what not, is made liable to severe<br>and incessant liability of a penal kind, for what?",
          "Every person of Chinese origin, whether<br>naturalized in Hong Kong or America, or any other<br>State with which we are at amity, so long as they<br>are of Chinese origin, 14 years of age—every one<br>without distinction—must take out a license.",
          "He considered “China the home of small pox,” and<br>that it was “an infected place”; that, in China,<br>small pox was “endemic,” i.e., always there;<br>because there “inoculation” was the universal<br>practice and was a constant source of danger; that<br>in England and Europe and America, generally,<br>vaccination, of late years, has been the rule.",
          "He does not include Japanese in the same category<br>as Chinese.",
          "He had no opinion to express as to the British<br>possession of Hongkong; but it was a portion of<br>China, where small pox was always, in a sense,<br>\"endemic.\"",
          "He reviewed the legislation against Chinese since<br>confederation, contending it was levelled against<br>a particular race of aliens and, therefore, beyond<br>provincial control, per *Gwynne*, J., in *Citizens<br>Insurance Co. v. Parsons*, 4 S. C. R., at p. 346.",
          "He thought that too close a scrutiny could not be<br>made of Chinese passengers.",
          "Held, that the “Chinese Regulation Act, 1884,” is<br>ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature, on the<br>following grounds:   1.",
          "His duty was, if he considered the Empress of<br>China came from \"an infected locality,\" at once to<br>go on board the suspected vessel and make his<br>examination and inspection on board the vessel (as<br>Section 32 says), \"before any luggage, freight or<br>other thing is landed or allowed to be landed.",
          "However difficult or impossible for any Chinese to<br>find a district collector, if such Chinese is<br>\"found without a license he is liable to a fine of<br>$40.\"",
          "If a man employ a Chinaman who should happen to be<br>delinquent in his tax, and he happens to occupy a<br>cottage or room of his employer, with his master's<br>goods in it, under section 10 they are liable to<br>seizure and sale.",
          "If its object were successful and Chinese driven<br>from the country, the customs dues received from<br>the Chinese would be lost and the benefits of<br>trade relations enjoyed by the merchants would be<br>destroyed.",
          "In another California case, *In re Tiburcio<br>Parrott*, it is laid down that if the apparent<br>object of a statute is under a pretense of the<br>exercise of constitutional powers to drive Chinese<br>away, the end sought to be obtained being<br>unlawful, the statute is void.",
          "In other words, every Chinese is guilty until<br>proved innocent—a provision which fills one<br>conversant with subjects with alarm; for if such a<br>law can be tolerated as against Chinese, the<br>precedent is set, and in time of any popular<br>outcry can easily be acted on for putting any<br>other foreigners or even special classes among<br>ourselves, as coloured people, or French,<br>Italians, Americans, or Germans, under equally the<br>same law.",
          "In the case of the Chinese treaties, they were<br>forced at the point of the bayonet on China, to<br>obtain a right for us to enter China, and in<br>return for a similar permission to us, full<br>permission was given for the Chinese to trade and<br>reside in British dominions everywhere.",
          "In the treaties of 1858 and 1860, made at the<br>solicitation of Great Britain, the Emperor of<br>China was induced to give permission to his<br>subjects to go and trade and reside \"in British<br>Colonies,\" and to enter into \"engagements with<br>British subjects for that purpose.\"",
          "It interfered with aliens as well as trade and<br>commerce, which cannot subsist among nations<br>without personal intercourse, which such an Act<br>(as far as China was concerned) would have a<br>tendency to prohibit.",
          "It is a great assumption of power on the part of a<br>Province to pass laws, the effect of which must be<br>practically to expel a particular class of aliens<br>from that Province, to say in effect that it will<br>by its legislation impede or prevent that class<br>from being employed in another Province—say the<br>North-west Territory or Manitoba—where railway<br>works may be languishing for want of that very<br>class of labourers, British Columbia being the<br>only sea-board of Canada on the Pacific through<br>which (in face of the restrictive laws of the<br>United States) that class of labourers can enter<br>and pass through; that is, in fact, legislating on<br>all inter-provincial immigration; in other words,<br>such legislation is ultra vires, and so I<br>pronounce it; and adjudge accordingly, and quash<br>the conviction, with costs.",
          "It is an infraction of the existing treaties<br>between the Imperial Government and China.",
          "It is enough to add that \"any person,\" no matter<br>whether white or Chinese, imprisoned in respect of<br>any infraction of the provisions of the Act, may<br>be at the will of the executive, subjected even to<br>hard labour.",
          "It is impossible but that such an imposition so<br>enforced, in addition to all the general taxes to<br>which he is subject, should make this country too<br>hot for him to live in; and just in proportion as<br>he is so persecuted out of the country, in that<br>degree does this enactment interfere with trade<br>and commerce and that control over aliens<br>exclusively given to the Dominion.",
          "It is shewn that he did not personally examine a<br>single Chinaman or inquire if he was “an infected<br>or exposed person.”",
          "It was his opinion that every one should be<br>examined who comes from China or from any<br>\"infected port.",
          "Its object, though not apparent on the face of the<br>Act, was to prevent Chinese coming into the<br>Province and drive out those who had already come.",
          "Legislation as to aliens is reserved to the<br>Dominion.",
          "No; an act or default of a stranger, a man whose<br>language he knows not, and for every infraction of<br>the Act by the Chinese under his employ.",
          "Now this assumes, as Dr. Davie assumed, that<br>Hongkong, although a British port and subject to<br>quarantine regulations, was (which includes the<br>time of the steamer's departure) and is a cradle<br>of small pox, and that every ship coming thence to<br>Victoria, especially with Chinese on board, should<br>be subject to the most searching examination, and<br>the drastic treatment I have described.",
          "Now, applying this test to the statute before us,<br>let us see whether and how far its provisions<br>affect, as is alleged, aliens, or trade, or<br>commerce.",
          "Opponents to the Act might as well contend the<br>exclusion of the Chinese from the franchise, and<br>barring them from acquiring lands, was illegal.",
          "So far, I have dealt with the Act on its own<br>merits; but if we consider it in juxtaposition to<br>the Dominion Act recently passed restricting the<br>Chinese throughout all Canada, its illegality<br>becomes transparent; for in passing that Act<br>against the Chinese the Dominion has spoken by the<br>highest authority which it possesses—its own<br>Parliament.",
          "Still both Federal Governments have reserved to<br>themselves the regulation of trade and commerce<br>and naturalization and aliens; so the analogy is<br>so close as to become almost a direct authority.",
          "Sub-section 2 of section 91 gives to the Dominion<br>Parliament exclusively the regulation of “trade<br>and commerce,” and by sub-section 25 that of<br>“naturalization and aliens,” and everything<br>relating to those subjects as affecting the whole<br>Dominion is within the Dominion powers, and no<br>local Legislature can make any statute interfering<br>with either of those subjects.",
          "That certainly is interfering with aliens.",
          "That it interfered with the Dominion powers under<br>the B. N. A. Act over aliens and naturalization.",
          "That it interfered with the Dominion powers under<br>the B. N. A. Act, aliens, and naturalization; 2nd.",
          "That small pox must have been in China on the 19th<br>April last, the date when the Empress left<br>Hongkong, as it was always there.",
          "That the Chinese might be taxed as other<br>residents, but could not be set apart as special<br>objects of the taxation, and be compelled to<br>contribute to the revenue of the State in the<br>character of foreigners.",
          "That there was danger of infection from white<br>passengers, but not the same danger as from<br>Chinamen.\"",
          "The Act is found associated with another Act now<br>disallowed, the express object of which is to<br>prevent the Chinese altogether from coming to this<br>country, and the principle \"noscitur a sociis\" is<br>kept up by the preamble of the present Act, which<br>describes the Chinese in terms which, I venture to<br>think, have never before in any other country<br>found a place in an Act of Parliament.",
          "The Act is so full of provisions that interfere<br>directly with aliens, with trade, and with<br>commerce, that I have no hesitation in pronouncing<br>all such provisions, and among them those under<br>which the appellant in this case has been<br>convicted, to be ultra vires the local<br>legislature, and consequently illegal and void.",
          "The California cases (see The People v. Naglee, 1<br>Cal. 232) decided a differential tax might be<br>imposed on foreign miners; and though a later case<br>(Lin Sing v. Washburn, 20 Cal. 334) had decided a<br>special tax could not be imposed on Chinese, a<br>most celebrated Judge, Mr. Justice Field (since<br>elevated to the Federal bench), dissented, and had<br>pointed out that according to federal decisions<br>the State might impose special taxation on alien<br>residents, provided the impost was not levied<br>against foreigners landing in the country.",
          "The Chinamen had already been examined on board<br>the ship by the Dominion Quarantine Officers and<br>Provincial officers and passed.",
          "The Chinese are chiefly dressed in woollen<br>materials and these harbour infection for weeks<br>and months.",
          "The Dominion under the B. N. A. Act had alone the<br>right of performing in Canada the obligations of<br>Canada as part of the British Empire in respect of<br>treaties, and although Canada might pass laws<br>prohibiting immigration, or having that tendency,<br>the Province could not do so, nor could it pass<br>laws in derogation of treaties.",
          "The action is one nominally rather than really,<br>for damages against Dr. George Duncan, the Health<br>Officer of the City of Victoria, on account of an<br>alleged excess of duty in despatching en masse,<br>without examination or enquiry, a number of<br>Chinamen out to the suspect station at Ross Bay,<br>there to be disinfected and scrubbed.",
          "The aliens in this case being Chinese, the first<br>enquiry must be, what is the object of the Act?",
          "The amount of business transacted by Chinamen in<br>British Columbia, as revealed by the tables in<br>that Chinese Report, is something which a casual<br>observer would have no idea of.",
          "The basis, then, of our enquiry must be: Is this<br>Chinese Regulation Act of 1884—rather the parts of<br>it objected to—within the limit of subjects and<br>area of section 92, or does it exceed those limits<br>in which it is supreme, and interfere with aliens,<br>trade and commerce in such a manner as to encroach<br>on section 91 or any of its sub-sections?",
          "The case was tried before a jury upon the issue<br>whether Hongkong, the last port the steamer left<br>in China, was or not “an infected locality.”",
          "The grounds alleged by the Health Officer for this<br>arbitrary treatment is “that China is an infected<br>locality,” and all persons coming from China and<br>especially in this instance Hongkong, and<br>especially also the natives of China, come from an<br>infected locality, and that he has that authority<br>under the Health By-Law, 1893, which was passed at<br>the time of the small pox panic in Victoria, and,<br>in all he did, was simply doing his duty.",
          "The law did not deal with the conditions under<br>which aliens might acquire rights or become<br>subjects of Her Majesty.",
          "The occasion was the arrival of the Empress of<br>China at the Outer Wharf, which is within the city<br>limits of Victoria, on the 1st day of May, 1894,<br>from China and Hongkong.",
          "The only evidence of Hong Kong being a place<br>infected, etc., was that of a medical man resident<br>in Victoria, who said \"That in China small pox was<br>endemic, because there inoculation was the<br>universal practice.",
          "The palpable object of such a provision, or set of<br>provisions, is to render the employment of Chinese<br>so distasteful and annoying to the employer that<br>he must cease to employ them.",
          "The plaintiff and other Chinamen similarly<br>situated obtained a writ of Habeas Corpus, upon<br>which they were discharged from this custody.",
          "The power asserted in the Act in question (the<br>California Act) is the right of the State to<br>prescribe the terms upon which the Chinese shall<br>be permitted to reside in it, and be so used as to<br>cut off all intercourse between them and the<br>people of the State, and defeat the commercial<br>policy of the nation.",
          "The provisions of the Act I have given somewhat in<br>extenso bear out that view, and the concurrent and<br>previous local legislation bear out the same<br>impression, for on the same day as this Act was<br>passed, another Act was passed, the very object of<br>which was plainly stated to be \"to prevent the<br>immigration\" of Chinese.\"",
          "The reports of the higher California courts are of<br>great authority for us on all Chinese questions,<br>for there have been efforts for years past to<br>restrict Chinese immigration in California, and<br>the matter has been constantly before the superior<br>courts there, and the judges there (if we may take<br>the reports as correct) are more than ordinarily<br>skilled in laying down the law correctly in<br>constitutional points of that nature.",
          "The same provisions that apply to Chinese may be<br>made to apply also to Americans, Frenchmen,<br>Germans, or any other foreigners.",
          "The tax was not to exclude the Chinese — another<br>statute with that object had been disallowed.",
          "The treaties I have quoted between Great Britain<br>and China, binding on the Dominion and on us in<br>British Columbia, secure to the Chinese, just as<br>the treaties between Great Britain and other<br>foreign countries secure to other foreigners, the<br>same rights in regard to the equality of taxation<br>which I have described as being enjoyed by<br>citizens of this country.",
          "The treaties between Great Britain and China,<br>which bind us, have been quoted.",
          "The treaty of 25th August, 1842, *Hertslet*, Vol.<br>6, ratified 26th June, 1843, p. 221, and Lord<br>Elgin's treaty of October, 1860, authenticated<br>copies of which were produced in Court, secure to<br>Chinese coming into British dominions the same<br>\"full security for persons and property as<br>subjects of Her Majesty.\"",
          "The whole Act teems with special provisions which<br>affect not only Chinese, but their employers, with<br>obligations and liabilities as to the conduct of<br>the Chinese in their employ, that no reasonable<br>man would encounter, and run the risk of the penal<br>consequences which the Act hangs over him.",
          "There was danger of infection from white<br>passengers, but not the same danger as from<br>Chinamen.",
          "There were several other diseases to be guarded<br>against from China, e.g., cholera, leprosy, etc.",
          "Thereupon the present action was brought to test<br>if and how far Chinamen are to be treated, when<br>they land on our shores, differently from other<br>foreigners.",
          "What is that but interfering with aliens, trade,<br>and commerce?",

          "In the French colony of Cayenne, the Town Council<br>recently handicapped the superior capacities of<br>the Chinaman by imposing on merchants of that<br>empire an extra tax of $300 per annum, deeming it<br>also expedient to handicap English and German<br>traders by a surtax of $200 on them.",

          "In other words, every Chinese is guilty until<br>proved innocent—a provision which fills one<br>conversant with subjects with alarm; for if such a<br>law can be tolerated as against Chinese, the<br>precedent is set, and in time of any popular<br>outcry can easily be acted on for putting any<br>other foreigners or even special classes among<br>ourselves, as coloured people, or French,<br>Italians, Americans, or Germans, under equally the<br>same law.",

          "It is a great assumption of power on the part of a<br>Province to pass laws, the effect of which must be<br>practically to expel a particular class of aliens<br>from that Province, to say in effect that it will<br>by its legislation impede or prevent that class<br>from being employed in another Province—say the<br>North-west Territory or Manitoba—where railway<br>works may be languishing for want of that very<br>class of labourers, British Columbia being the<br>only sea-board of Canada on the Pacific through<br>which (in face of the restrictive laws of the<br>United States) that class of labourers can enter<br>and pass through; that is, in fact, legislating on<br>all inter-provincial immigration; in other words,<br>such legislation is ultra vires, and so I<br>pronounce it; and adjudge accordingly, and quash<br>the conviction, with costs.",
          "It is an infraction of the existing treaties<br>between the Imperial Government and China.",

          "It is impossible but that such an imposition so<br>enforced, in addition to all the general taxes to<br>which he is subject, should make this country too<br>hot for him to live in; and just in proportion as<br>he is so persecuted out of the country, in that<br>degree does this enactment interfere with trade<br>and commerce and that control over aliens<br>exclusively given to the Dominion.",
          "It is shewn that he did not personally examine a<br>single Chinaman or inquire if he was “an infected<br>or exposed person.”",
          "It was his opinion that every one should be<br>examined who comes from China or from any<br>\"infected port.",
          "Its object, though not apparent on the face of the<br>Act, was to prevent Chinese coming into the<br>Province and drive out those who had already come.",
          "Legislation as to aliens is reserved to the<br>Dominion.",
          "No; an act or default of a stranger, a man whose<br>language he knows not, and for every infraction of<br>the Act by the Chinese under his employ.",
          "Now this assumes, as Dr. Davie assumed, that<br>Hongkong, although a British port and subject to<br>quarantine regulations, was (which includes the<br>time of the steamer's departure) and is a cradle<br>of small pox, and that every ship coming thence to<br>Victoria, especially with Chinese on board, should<br>be subject to the most searching examination, and<br>the drastic treatment I have described.",
          "Now, applying this test to the statute before us,<br>let us see whether and how far its provisions<br>affect, as is alleged, aliens, or trade, or<br>commerce.",
          "Opponents to the Act might as well contend the<br>exclusion of the Chinese from the franchise, and<br>barring them from acquiring lands, was illegal.",
          "So far, I have dealt with the Act on its own<br>merits; but if we consider it in juxtaposition to<br>the Dominion Act recently passed restricting the<br>Chinese throughout all Canada, its illegality<br>becomes transparent; for in passing that Act<br>against the Chinese the Dominion has spoken by the<br>highest authority which it possesses—its own<br>Parliament.",
          "Still both Federal Governments have reserved to<br>themselves the regulation of trade and commerce<br>and naturalization and aliens; so the analogy is<br>so close as to become almost a direct authority.",
          "Sub-section 2 of section 91 gives to the Dominion<br>Parliament exclusively the regulation of “trade<br>and commerce,” and by sub-section 25 that of<br>“naturalization and aliens,” and everything<br>relating to those subjects as affecting the whole<br>Dominion is within the Dominion powers, and no<br>local Legislature can make any statute interfering<br>with either of those subjects.",
          "That certainly is interfering with aliens.",
          "That it interfered with the Dominion powers under<br>the B. N. A. Act over aliens and naturalization.",
          "That it interfered with the Dominion powers under<br>the B. N. A. Act, aliens, and naturalization; 2nd.",
          "That small pox must have been in China on the 19th<br>April last, the date when the Empress left<br>Hongkong, as it was always there.",
          "That the Chinese might be taxed as other<br>residents, but could not be set apart as special<br>objects of the taxation, and be compelled to<br>contribute to the revenue of the State in the<br>character of foreigners.",
          "That there was danger of infection from white<br>passengers, but not the same danger as from<br>Chinamen.\"",
          "The Act is found associated with another Act now<br>disallowed, the express object of which is to<br>prevent the Chinese altogether from coming to this<br>country, and the principle \"noscitur a sociis\" is<br>kept up by the preamble of the present Act, which<br>describes the Chinese in terms which, I venture to<br>think, have never before in any other country<br>found a place in an Act of Parliament.",
          "The Act is so full of provisions that interfere<br>directly with aliens, with trade, and with<br>commerce, that I have no hesitation in pronouncing<br>all such provisions, and among them those under<br>which the appellant in this case has been<br>convicted, to be ultra vires the local<br>legislature, and consequently illegal and void.",
          "The California cases (see The People v. Naglee, 1<br>Cal. 232) decided a differential tax might be<br>imposed on foreign miners; and though a later case<br>(Lin Sing v. Washburn, 20 Cal. 334) had decided a<br>special tax could not be imposed on Chinese, a<br>most celebrated Judge, Mr. Justice Field (since<br>elevated to the Federal bench), dissented, and had<br>pointed out that according to federal decisions<br>the State might impose special taxation on alien<br>residents, provided the impost was not levied<br>against foreigners landing in the country.",
          "The Chinamen had already been examined on board<br>the ship by the Dominion Quarantine Officers and<br>Provincial officers and passed.",
          "The Chinese are chiefly dressed in woollen<br>materials and these harbour infection for weeks<br>and months.",
          "The Dominion under the B. N. A. Act had alone the<br>right of performing in Canada the obligations of<br>Canada as part of the British Empire in respect of<br>treaties, and although Canada might pass laws<br>prohibiting immigration, or having that tendency,<br>the Province could not do so, nor could it pass<br>laws in derogation of treaties.",
          "The action is one nominally rather than really,<br>for damages against Dr. George Duncan, the Health<br>Officer of the City of Victoria, on account of an<br>alleged excess of duty in despatching en masse,<br>without examination or enquiry, a number of<br>Chinamen out to the suspect station at Ross Bay,<br>there to be disinfected and scrubbed.",
          "The aliens in this case being Chinese, the first<br>enquiry must be, what is the object of the Act?",
          "The amount of business transacted by Chinamen in<br>British Columbia, as revealed by the tables in<br>that Chinese Report, is something which a casual<br>observer would have no idea of.",
          "The basis, then, of our enquiry must be: Is this<br>Chinese Regulation Act of 1884—rather the parts of<br>it objected to—within the limit of subjects and<br>area of section 92, or does it exceed those limits<br>in which it is supreme, and interfere with aliens,<br>trade and commerce in such a manner as to encroach<br>on section 91 or any of its sub-sections?",
          "The case was tried before a jury upon the issue<br>whether Hongkong, the last port the steamer left<br>in China, was or not “an infected locality.”",
          "The grounds alleged by the Health Officer for this<br>arbitrary treatment is “that China is an infected<br>locality,” and all persons coming from China and<br>especially in this instance Hongkong, and<br>especially also the natives of China, come from an<br>infected locality, and that he has that authority<br>under the Health By-Law, 1893, which was passed at<br>the time of the small pox panic in Victoria, and,<br>in all he did, was simply doing his duty.",
          "The law did not deal with the conditions under<br>which aliens might acquire rights or become<br>subjects of Her Majesty.",
          "The occasion was the arrival of the Empress of<br>China at the Outer Wharf, which is within the city<br>limits of Victoria, on the 1st day of May, 1894,<br>from China and Hongkong.",
          "The only evidence of Hong Kong being a place<br>infected, etc., was that of a medical man resident<br>in Victoria, who said \"That in China small pox was<br>endemic, because there inoculation was the<br>universal practice.",
          "The palpable object of such a provision, or set of<br>provisions, is to render the employment of Chinese<br>so distasteful and annoying to the employer that<br>he must cease to employ them.",
          "The plaintiff and other Chinamen similarly<br>situated obtained a writ of Habeas Corpus, upon<br>which they were discharged from this custody.",
          "The power asserted in the Act in question (the<br>California Act) is the right of the State to<br>prescribe the terms upon which the Chinese shall<br>be permitted to reside in it, and be so used as to<br>cut off all intercourse between them and the<br>people of the State, and defeat the commercial<br>policy of the nation.",
          "The provisions of the Act I have given somewhat in<br>extenso bear out that view, and the concurrent and<br>previous local legislation bear out the same<br>impression, for on the same day as this Act was<br>passed, another Act was passed, the very object of<br>which was plainly stated to be \"to prevent the<br>immigration\" of Chinese.\"",
          "The reports of the higher California courts are of<br>great authority for us on all Chinese questions,<br>for there have been efforts for years past to<br>restrict Chinese immigration in California, and<br>the matter has been constantly before the superior<br>courts there, and the judges there (if we may take<br>the reports as correct) are more than ordinarily<br>skilled in laying down the law correctly in<br>constitutional points of that nature.",
          "The same provisions that apply to Chinese may be<br>made to apply also to Americans, Frenchmen,<br>Germans, or any other foreigners.",
          "The tax was not to exclude the Chinese — another<br>statute with that object had been disallowed.",
          "The treaties I have quoted between Great Britain<br>and China, binding on the Dominion and on us in<br>British Columbia, secure to the Chinese, just as<br>the treaties between Great Britain and other<br>foreign countries secure to other foreigners, the<br>same rights in regard to the equality of taxation<br>which I have described as being enjoyed by<br>citizens of this country.",
          "The treaties between Great Britain and China,<br>which bind us, have been quoted.",
          "The treaty of 25th August, 1842, *Hertslet*, Vol.<br>6, ratified 26th June, 1843, p. 221, and Lord<br>Elgin's treaty of October, 1860, authenticated<br>copies of which were produced in Court, secure to<br>Chinese coming into British dominions the same<br>\"full security for persons and property as<br>subjects of Her Majesty.\"",
          "The whole Act teems with special provisions which<br>affect not only Chinese, but their employers, with<br>obligations and liabilities as to the conduct of<br>the Chinese in their employ, that no reasonable<br>man would encounter, and run the risk of the penal<br>consequences which the Act hangs over him.",
          "There was danger of infection from white<br>passengers, but not the same danger as from<br>Chinamen.",
          "There were several other diseases to be guarded<br>against from China, e.g., cholera, leprosy, etc.",
          "Thereupon the present action was brought to test<br>if and how far Chinamen are to be treated, when<br>they land on our shores, differently from other<br>foreigners.",
          "What is that but interfering with aliens, trade,<br>and commerce?",

          "Every employé of Chinese labour, whether English,<br>American, or what not, is made liable to severe<br>and incessant liability of a penal kind, for what?",
          "Every person of Chinese origin, whether<br>naturalized in Hong Kong or America, or any other<br>State with which we are at amity, so long as they<br>are of Chinese origin, 14 years of age—every one<br>without distinction—must take out a license.",
          "He considered “China the home of small pox,” and<br>that it was “an infected place”; that, in China,<br>small pox was “endemic,” i.e., always there;<br>because there “inoculation” was the universal<br>practice and was a constant source of danger; that<br>in England and Europe and America, generally,<br>vaccination, of late years, has been the rule.",
          "He does not include Japanese in the same category<br>as Chinese.",
          "He had no opinion to express as to the British<br>possession of Hongkong; but it was a portion of<br>China, where small pox was always, in a sense,<br>\"endemic.\"",
          "He reviewed the legislation against Chinese since<br>confederation, contending it was levelled against<br>a particular race of aliens and, therefore, beyond<br>provincial control, per *Gwynne*, J., in *Citizens<br>Insurance Co. v. Parsons*, 4 S. C. R., at p. 346.",
          "He thought that too close a scrutiny could not be<br>made of Chinese passengers.",
          "Held, that the “Chinese Regulation Act, 1884,” is<br>ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature, on the<br>following grounds:   1.",
          "His duty was, if he considered the Empress of<br>China came from \"an infected locality,\" at once to<br>go on board the suspected vessel and make his<br>examination and inspection on board the vessel (as<br>Section 32 says), \"before any luggage, freight or<br>other thing is landed or allowed to be landed.",
          "However difficult or impossible for any Chinese to<br>find a district collector, if such Chinese is<br>\"found without a license he is liable to a fine of<br>$40.\"",
          "If a man employ a Chinaman who should happen to be<br>delinquent in his tax, and he happens to occupy a<br>cottage or room of his employer, with his master's<br>goods in it, under section 10 they are liable to<br>seizure and sale.",
          "If its object were successful and Chinese driven<br>from the country, the customs dues received from<br>the Chinese would be lost and the benefits of<br>trade relations enjoyed by the merchants would be<br>destroyed.",
          "In another California case, *In re Tiburcio<br>Parrott*, it is laid down that if the apparent<br>object of a statute is under a pretense of the<br>exercise of constitutional powers to drive Chinese<br>away, the end sought to be obtained being<br>unlawful, the statute is void.",
          "In other words, every Chinese is guilty until<br>proved innocent—a provision which fills one<br>conversant with subjects with alarm; for if such a<br>law can be tolerated as against Chinese, the<br>precedent is set, and in time of any popular<br>outcry can easily be acted on for putting any<br>other foreigners or even special classes among<br>ourselves, as coloured people, or French,<br>Italians, Americans, or Germans, under equally the<br>same law.",
          "In the case of the Chinese treaties, they were<br>forced at the point of the bayonet on China, to<br>obtain a right for us to enter China, and in<br>return for a similar permission to us, full<br>permission was given for the Chinese to trade and<br>reside in British dominions everywhere.",
          "In the treaties of 1858 and 1860, made at the<br>solicitation of Great Britain, the Emperor of<br>China was induced to give permission to his<br>subjects to go and trade and reside \"in British<br>Colonies,\" and to enter into \"engagements with<br>British subjects for that purpose.\"",
          "It interfered with aliens as well as trade and<br>commerce, which cannot subsist among nations<br>without personal intercourse, which such an Act<br>(as far as China was concerned) would have a<br>tendency to prohibit.",
          "It is a great assumption of power on the part of a<br>Province to pass laws, the effect of which must be<br>practically to expel a particular class of aliens<br>from that Province, to say in effect that it will<br>by its legislation impede or prevent that class<br>from being employed in another Province—say the<br>North-west Territory or Manitoba—where railway<br>works may be languishing for want of that very<br>class of labourers, British Columbia being the<br>only sea-board of Canada on the Pacific through<br>which (in face of the restrictive laws of the<br>United States) that class of labourers can enter<br>and pass through; that is, in fact, legislating on<br>all inter-provincial immigration; in other words,<br>such legislation is ultra vires, and so I<br>pronounce it; and adjudge accordingly, and quash<br>the conviction, with costs.",
          "It is an infraction of the existing treaties<br>between the Imperial Government and China.",
          "It is enough to add that \"any person,\" no matter<br>whether white or Chinese, imprisoned in respect of<br>any infraction of the provisions of the Act, may<br>be at the will of the executive, subjected even to<br>hard labour.",
          "It is impossible but that such an imposition so<br>enforced, in addition to all the general taxes to<br>which he is subject, should make this country too<br>hot for him to live in; and just in proportion as<br>he is so persecuted out of the country, in that<br>degree does this enactment interfere with trade<br>and commerce and that control over aliens<br>exclusively given to the Dominion.",
          "It is shewn that he did not personally examine a<br>single Chinaman or inquire if he was “an infected<br>or exposed person.”",
          "It was his opinion that every one should be<br>examined who comes from China or from any<br>\"infected port.",
          "Its object, though not apparent on the face of the<br>Act, was to prevent Chinese coming into the<br>Province and drive out those who had already come.",
          "Legislation as to aliens is reserved to the<br>Dominion.",
          "No; an act or default of a stranger, a man whose<br>language he knows not, and for every infraction of<br>the Act by the Chinese under his employ.",
          "Now this assumes, as Dr. Davie assumed, that<br>Hongkong, although a British port and subject to<br>quarantine regulations, was (which includes the<br>time of the steamer's departure) and is a cradle<br>of small pox, and that every ship coming thence to<br>Victoria, especially with Chinese on board, should<br>be subject to the most searching examination, and<br>the drastic treatment I have described.",
          "Now, applying this test to the statute before us,<br>let us see whether and how far its provisions<br>affect, as is alleged, aliens, or trade, or<br>commerce.",
          "Opponents to the Act might as well contend the<br>exclusion of the Chinese from the franchise, and<br>barring them from acquiring lands, was illegal.",
          "So far, I have dealt with the Act on its own<br>merits; but if we consider it in juxtaposition to<br>the Dominion Act recently passed restricting the<br>Chinese throughout all Canada, its illegality<br>becomes transparent; for in passing that Act<br>against the Chinese the Dominion has spoken by the<br>highest authority which it possesses—its own<br>Parliament.",
          "Still both Federal Governments have reserved to<br>themselves the regulation of trade and commerce<br>and naturalization and aliens; so the analogy is<br>so close as to become almost a direct authority.",
          "Sub-section 2 of section 91 gives to the Dominion<br>Parliament exclusively the regulation of “trade<br>and commerce,” and by sub-section 25 that of<br>“naturalization and aliens,” and everything<br>relating to those subjects as affecting the whole<br>Dominion is within the Dominion powers, and no<br>local Legislature can make any statute interfering<br>with either of those subjects.",
          "That certainly is interfering with aliens.",
          "That it interfered with the Dominion powers under<br>the B. N. A. Act over aliens and naturalization.",
          "That it interfered with the Dominion powers under<br>the B. N. A. Act, aliens, and naturalization; 2nd.",
          "That small pox must have been in China on the 19th<br>April last, the date when the Empress left<br>Hongkong, as it was always there.",
          "That the Chinese might be taxed as other<br>residents, but could not be set apart as special<br>objects of the taxation, and be compelled to<br>contribute to the revenue of the State in the<br>character of foreigners.",
          "That there was danger of infection from white<br>passengers, but not the same danger as from<br>Chinamen.\"",
          "The Act is found associated with another Act now<br>disallowed, the express object of which is to<br>prevent the Chinese altogether from coming to this<br>country, and the principle \"noscitur a sociis\" is<br>kept up by the preamble of the present Act, which<br>describes the Chinese in terms which, I venture to<br>think, have never before in any other country<br>found a place in an Act of Parliament.",
          "The Act is so full of provisions that interfere<br>directly with aliens, with trade, and with<br>commerce, that I have no hesitation in pronouncing<br>all such provisions, and among them those under<br>which the appellant in this case has been<br>convicted, to be ultra vires the local<br>legislature, and consequently illegal and void.",
          "The California cases (see The People v. Naglee, 1<br>Cal. 232) decided a differential tax might be<br>imposed on foreign miners; and though a later case<br>(Lin Sing v. Washburn, 20 Cal. 334) had decided a<br>special tax could not be imposed on Chinese, a<br>most celebrated Judge, Mr. Justice Field (since<br>elevated to the Federal bench), dissented, and had<br>pointed out that according to federal decisions<br>the State might impose special taxation on alien<br>residents, provided the impost was not levied<br>against foreigners landing in the country.",
          "The Chinamen had already been examined on board<br>the ship by the Dominion Quarantine Officers and<br>Provincial officers and passed.",
          "The Chinese are chiefly dressed in woollen<br>materials and these harbour infection for weeks<br>and months.",
          "The Dominion under the B. N. A. Act had alone the<br>right of performing in Canada the obligations of<br>Canada as part of the British Empire in respect of<br>treaties, and although Canada might pass laws<br>prohibiting immigration, or having that tendency,<br>the Province could not do so, nor could it pass<br>laws in derogation of treaties.",
          "The action is one nominally rather than really,<br>for damages against Dr. George Duncan, the Health<br>Officer of the City of Victoria, on account of an<br>alleged excess of duty in despatching en masse,<br>without examination or enquiry, a number of<br>Chinamen out to the suspect station at Ross Bay,<br>there to be disinfected and scrubbed.",
          "The aliens in this case being Chinese, the first<br>enquiry must be, what is the object of the Act?",
          "The amount of business transacted by Chinamen in<br>British Columbia, as revealed by the tables in<br>that Chinese Report, is something which a casual<br>observer would have no idea of.",
          "The basis, then, of our enquiry must be: Is this<br>Chinese Regulation Act of 1884—rather the parts of<br>it objected to—within the limit of subjects and<br>area of section 92, or does it exceed those limits<br>in which it is supreme, and interfere with aliens,<br>trade and commerce in such a manner as to encroach<br>on section 91 or any of its sub-sections?",
          "The case was tried before a jury upon the issue<br>whether Hongkong, the last port the steamer left<br>in China, was or not “an infected locality.”",
          "The grounds alleged by the Health Officer for this<br>arbitrary treatment is “that China is an infected<br>locality,” and all persons coming from China and<br>especially in this instance Hongkong, and<br>especially also the natives of China, come from an<br>infected locality, and that he has that authority<br>under the Health By-Law, 1893, which was passed at<br>the time of the small pox panic in Victoria, and,<br>in all he did, was simply doing his duty.",
          "The law did not deal with the conditions under<br>which aliens might acquire rights or become<br>subjects of Her Majesty.",
          "The occasion was the arrival of the Empress of<br>China at the Outer Wharf, which is within the city<br>limits of Victoria, on the 1st day of May, 1894,<br>from China and Hongkong.",
          "The only evidence of Hong Kong being a place<br>infected, etc., was that of a medical man resident<br>in Victoria, who said \"That in China small pox was<br>endemic, because there inoculation was the<br>universal practice.",
          "The palpable object of such a provision, or set of<br>provisions, is to render the employment of Chinese<br>so distasteful and annoying to the employer that<br>he must cease to employ them.",
          "The plaintiff and other Chinamen similarly<br>situated obtained a writ of Habeas Corpus, upon<br>which they were discharged from this custody.",
          "The power asserted in the Act in question (the<br>California Act) is the right of the State to<br>prescribe the terms upon which the Chinese shall<br>be permitted to reside in it, and be so used as to<br>cut off all intercourse between them and the<br>people of the State, and defeat the commercial<br>policy of the nation.",
          "The provisions of the Act I have given somewhat in<br>extenso bear out that view, and the concurrent and<br>previous local legislation bear out the same<br>impression, for on the same day as this Act was<br>passed, another Act was passed, the very object of<br>which was plainly stated to be \"to prevent the<br>immigration\" of Chinese.\"",
          "The reports of the higher California courts are of<br>great authority for us on all Chinese questions,<br>for there have been efforts for years past to<br>restrict Chinese immigration in California, and<br>the matter has been constantly before the superior<br>courts there, and the judges there (if we may take<br>the reports as correct) are more than ordinarily<br>skilled in laying down the law correctly in<br>constitutional points of that nature.",
          "The same provisions that apply to Chinese may be<br>made to apply also to Americans, Frenchmen,<br>Germans, or any other foreigners.",
          "The tax was not to exclude the Chinese — another<br>statute with that object had been disallowed.",
          "The treaties I have quoted between Great Britain<br>and China, binding on the Dominion and on us in<br>British Columbia, secure to the Chinese, just as<br>the treaties between Great Britain and other<br>foreign countries secure to other foreigners, the<br>same rights in regard to the equality of taxation<br>which I have described as being enjoyed by<br>citizens of this country.",
          "The treaties between Great Britain and China,<br>which bind us, have been quoted.",
          "The treaty of 25th August, 1842, *Hertslet*, Vol.<br>6, ratified 26th June, 1843, p. 221, and Lord<br>Elgin's treaty of October, 1860, authenticated<br>copies of which were produced in Court, secure to<br>Chinese coming into British dominions the same<br>\"full security for persons and property as<br>subjects of Her Majesty.\"",
          "The whole Act teems with special provisions which<br>affect not only Chinese, but their employers, with<br>obligations and liabilities as to the conduct of<br>the Chinese in their employ, that no reasonable<br>man would encounter, and run the risk of the penal<br>consequences which the Act hangs over him.",
          "There was danger of infection from white<br>passengers, but not the same danger as from<br>Chinamen.",
          "There were several other diseases to be guarded<br>against from China, e.g., cholera, leprosy, etc.",
          "Thereupon the present action was brought to test<br>if and how far Chinamen are to be treated, when<br>they land on our shores, differently from other<br>foreigners.",
          "What is that but interfering with aliens, trade,<br>and commerce?",

          "And it is roundly alleged by the appellant that<br>this tax is imposed, not with the object of<br>raising a revenue for the City, but with the<br>object of harassing Chinamen, supposed to be the<br>only persons carrying on this industry.",

          "I rather think that the auctioneers would<br>repudiate this alleged similarity of their<br>occupation to that of a Chinese washerman.",
          "I, for my part, cannot arrive at any other<br>conclusion than that it is specially directed<br>against Chinamen because they are Chinamen and for<br>no other Judgment.",

          "In the French colony of Cayenne, the Town Council<br>recently handicapped the superior capacities of<br>the Chinaman by imposing on merchants of that<br>empire an extra tax of $300 per annum, deeming it<br>also expedient to handicap English and German<br>traders by a surtax of $200 on them.",

          "It was his opinion that every one should be<br>examined who comes from China or from any<br>\"infected port.",
          "Its object, though not apparent on the face of the<br>Act, was to prevent Chinese coming into the<br>Province and drive out those who had already come.",
          "Legislation as to aliens is reserved to the<br>Dominion.",
          "No; an act or default of a stranger, a man whose<br>language he knows not, and for every infraction of<br>the Act by the Chinese under his employ.",
          "Now this assumes, as Dr. Davie assumed, that<br>Hongkong, although a British port and subject to<br>quarantine regulations, was (which includes the<br>time of the steamer's departure) and is a cradle<br>of small pox, and that every ship coming thence to<br>Victoria, especially with Chinese on board, should<br>be subject to the most searching examination, and<br>the drastic treatment I have described.",
          "Now, applying this test to the statute before us,<br>let us see whether and how far its provisions<br>affect, as is alleged, aliens, or trade, or<br>commerce.",
          "Opponents to the Act might as well contend the<br>exclusion of the Chinese from the franchise, and<br>barring them from acquiring lands, was illegal.",
          "So far, I have dealt with the Act on its own<br>merits; but if we consider it in juxtaposition to<br>the Dominion Act recently passed restricting the<br>Chinese throughout all Canada, its illegality<br>becomes transparent; for in passing that Act<br>against the Chinese the Dominion has spoken by the<br>highest authority which it possesses—its own<br>Parliament.",
          "Still both Federal Governments have reserved to<br>themselves the regulation of trade and commerce<br>and naturalization and aliens; so the analogy is<br>so close as to become almost a direct authority.",
          "Sub-section 2 of section 91 gives to the Dominion<br>Parliament exclusively the regulation of “trade<br>and commerce,” and by sub-section 25 that of<br>“naturalization and aliens,” and everything<br>relating to those subjects as affecting the whole<br>Dominion is within the Dominion powers, and no<br>local Legislature can make any statute interfering<br>with either of those subjects.",
          "That certainly is interfering with aliens.",
          "That it interfered with the Dominion powers under<br>the B. N. A. Act over aliens and naturalization.",
          "That it interfered with the Dominion powers under<br>the B. N. A. Act, aliens, and naturalization; 2nd.",
          "That small pox must have been in China on the 19th<br>April last, the date when the Empress left<br>Hongkong, as it was always there.",
          "That the Chinese might be taxed as other<br>residents, but could not be set apart as special<br>objects of the taxation, and be compelled to<br>contribute to the revenue of the State in the<br>character of foreigners.",
          "That there was danger of infection from white<br>passengers, but not the same danger as from<br>Chinamen.\"",
          "The Act is found associated with another Act now<br>disallowed, the express object of which is to<br>prevent the Chinese altogether from coming to this<br>country, and the principle \"noscitur a sociis\" is<br>kept up by the preamble of the present Act, which<br>describes the Chinese in terms which, I venture to<br>think, have never before in any other country<br>found a place in an Act of Parliament.",
          "The Act is so full of provisions that interfere<br>directly with aliens, with trade, and with<br>commerce, that I have no hesitation in pronouncing<br>all such provisions, and among them those under<br>which the appellant in this case has been<br>convicted, to be ultra vires the local<br>legislature, and consequently illegal and void.",
          "The California cases (see The People v. Naglee, 1<br>Cal. 232) decided a differential tax might be<br>imposed on foreign miners; and though a later case<br>(Lin Sing v. Washburn, 20 Cal. 334) had decided a<br>special tax could not be imposed on Chinese, a<br>most celebrated Judge, Mr. Justice Field (since<br>elevated to the Federal bench), dissented, and had<br>pointed out that according to federal decisions<br>the State might impose special taxation on alien<br>residents, provided the impost was not levied<br>against foreigners landing in the country.",
          "The Chinamen had already been examined on board<br>the ship by the Dominion Quarantine Officers and<br>Provincial officers and passed.",
          "The Chinese are chiefly dressed in woollen<br>materials and these harbour infection for weeks<br>and months.",
          "The Dominion under the B. N. A. Act had alone the<br>right of performing in Canada the obligations of<br>Canada as part of the British Empire in respect of<br>treaties, and although Canada might pass laws<br>prohibiting immigration, or having that tendency,<br>the Province could not do so, nor could it pass<br>laws in derogation of treaties.",
          "The action is one nominally rather than really,<br>for damages against Dr. George Duncan, the Health<br>Officer of the City of Victoria, on account of an<br>alleged excess of duty in despatching en masse,<br>without examination or enquiry, a number of<br>Chinamen out to the suspect station at Ross Bay,<br>there to be disinfected and scrubbed.",
          "The aliens in this case being Chinese, the first<br>enquiry must be, what is the object of the Act?",
          "The amount of business transacted by Chinamen in<br>British Columbia, as revealed by the tables in<br>that Chinese Report, is something which a casual<br>observer would have no idea of.",
          "The basis, then, of our enquiry must be: Is this<br>Chinese Regulation Act of 1884—rather the parts of<br>it objected to—within the limit of subjects and<br>area of section 92, or does it exceed those limits<br>in which it is supreme, and interfere with aliens,<br>trade and commerce in such a manner as to encroach<br>on section 91 or any of its sub-sections?",
          "The case was tried before a jury upon the issue<br>whether Hongkong, the last port the steamer left<br>in China, was or not “an infected locality.”",
          "The grounds alleged by the Health Officer for this<br>arbitrary treatment is “that China is an infected<br>locality,” and all persons coming from China and<br>especially in this instance Hongkong, and<br>especially also the natives of China, come from an<br>infected locality, and that he has that authority<br>under the Health By-Law, 1893, which was passed at<br>the time of the small pox panic in Victoria, and,<br>in all he did, was simply doing his duty.",
          "The law did not deal with the conditions under<br>which aliens might acquire rights or become<br>subjects of Her Majesty.",
          "The occasion was the arrival of the Empress of<br>China at the Outer Wharf, which is within the city<br>limits of Victoria, on the 1st day of May, 1894,<br>from China and Hongkong.",
          "The only evidence of Hong Kong being a place<br>infected, etc., was that of a medical man resident<br>in Victoria, who said \"That in China small pox was<br>endemic, because there inoculation was the<br>universal practice.",
          "The palpable object of such a provision, or set of<br>provisions, is to render the employment of Chinese<br>so distasteful and annoying to the employer that<br>he must cease to employ them.",
          "The plaintiff and other Chinamen similarly<br>situated obtained a writ of Habeas Corpus, upon<br>which they were discharged from this custody.",
          "The power asserted in the Act in question (the<br>California Act) is the right of the State to<br>prescribe the terms upon which the Chinese shall<br>be permitted to reside in it, and be so used as to<br>cut off all intercourse between them and the<br>people of the State, and defeat the commercial<br>policy of the nation.",
          "The provisions of the Act I have given somewhat in<br>extenso bear out that view, and the concurrent and<br>previous local legislation bear out the same<br>impression, for on the same day as this Act was<br>passed, another Act was passed, the very object of<br>which was plainly stated to be \"to prevent the<br>immigration\" of Chinese.\"",
          "The reports of the higher California courts are of<br>great authority for us on all Chinese questions,<br>for there have been efforts for years past to<br>restrict Chinese immigration in California, and<br>the matter has been constantly before the superior<br>courts there, and the judges there (if we may take<br>the reports as correct) are more than ordinarily<br>skilled in laying down the law correctly in<br>constitutional points of that nature.",
          "The same provisions that apply to Chinese may be<br>made to apply also to Americans, Frenchmen,<br>Germans, or any other foreigners.",
          "The tax was not to exclude the Chinese — another<br>statute with that object had been disallowed.",
          "The treaties I have quoted between Great Britain<br>and China, binding on the Dominion and on us in<br>British Columbia, secure to the Chinese, just as<br>the treaties between Great Britain and other<br>foreign countries secure to other foreigners, the<br>same rights in regard to the equality of taxation<br>which I have described as being enjoyed by<br>citizens of this country.",
          "The treaties between Great Britain and China,<br>which bind us, have been quoted.",
          "The treaty of 25th August, 1842, *Hertslet*, Vol.<br>6, ratified 26th June, 1843, p. 221, and Lord<br>Elgin's treaty of October, 1860, authenticated<br>copies of which were produced in Court, secure to<br>Chinese coming into British dominions the same<br>\"full security for persons and property as<br>subjects of Her Majesty.\"",
          "The whole Act teems with special provisions which<br>affect not only Chinese, but their employers, with<br>obligations and liabilities as to the conduct of<br>the Chinese in their employ, that no reasonable<br>man would encounter, and run the risk of the penal<br>consequences which the Act hangs over him.",
          "There was danger of infection from white<br>passengers, but not the same danger as from<br>Chinamen.",
          "There were several other diseases to be guarded<br>against from China, e.g., cholera, leprosy, etc.",
          "Thereupon the present action was brought to test<br>if and how far Chinamen are to be treated, when<br>they land on our shores, differently from other<br>foreigners.",

          "Every person of Chinese origin, whether<br>naturalized in Hong Kong or America, or any other<br>State with which we are at amity, so long as they<br>are of Chinese origin, 14 years of age—every one<br>without distinction—must take out a license.",
          "He considered “China the home of small pox,” and<br>that it was “an infected place”; that, in China,<br>small pox was “endemic,” i.e., always there;<br>because there “inoculation” was the universal<br>practice and was a constant source of danger; that<br>in England and Europe and America, generally,<br>vaccination, of late years, has been the rule.",
          "He does not include Japanese in the same category<br>as Chinese.",
          "He had no opinion to express as to the British<br>possession of Hongkong; but it was a portion of<br>China, where small pox was always, in a sense,<br>\"endemic.\"",
          "He reviewed the legislation against Chinese since<br>confederation, contending it was levelled against<br>a particular race of aliens and, therefore, beyond<br>provincial control, per *Gwynne*, J., in *Citizens<br>Insurance Co. v. Parsons*, 4 S. C. R., at p. 346.",
          "He thought that too close a scrutiny could not be<br>made of Chinese passengers.",
          "Held, that the “Chinese Regulation Act, 1884,” is<br>ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature, on the<br>following grounds:   1.",
          "His duty was, if he considered the Empress of<br>China came from \"an infected locality,\" at once to<br>go on board the suspected vessel and make his<br>examination and inspection on board the vessel (as<br>Section 32 says), \"before any luggage, freight or<br>other thing is landed or allowed to be landed.",
          "However difficult or impossible for any Chinese to<br>find a district collector, if such Chinese is<br>\"found without a license he is liable to a fine of<br>$40.\"",
          "If a man employ a Chinaman who should happen to be<br>delinquent in his tax, and he happens to occupy a<br>cottage or room of his employer, with his master's<br>goods in it, under section 10 they are liable to<br>seizure and sale.",
          "If its object were successful and Chinese driven<br>from the country, the customs dues received from<br>the Chinese would be lost and the benefits of<br>trade relations enjoyed by the merchants would be<br>destroyed.",
          "In another California case, *In re Tiburcio<br>Parrott*, it is laid down that if the apparent<br>object of a statute is under a pretense of the<br>exercise of constitutional powers to drive Chinese<br>away, the end sought to be obtained being<br>unlawful, the statute is void.",
          "In other words, every Chinese is guilty until<br>proved innocent—a provision which fills one<br>conversant with subjects with alarm; for if such a<br>law can be tolerated as against Chinese, the<br>precedent is set, and in time of any popular<br>outcry can easily be acted on for putting any<br>other foreigners or even special classes among<br>ourselves, as coloured people, or French,<br>Italians, Americans, or Germans, under equally the<br>same law.",
          "In the case of the Chinese treaties, they were<br>forced at the point of the bayonet on China, to<br>obtain a right for us to enter China, and in<br>return for a similar permission to us, full<br>permission was given for the Chinese to trade and<br>reside in British dominions everywhere.",
          "In the treaties of 1858 and 1860, made at the<br>solicitation of Great Britain, the Emperor of<br>China was induced to give permission to his<br>subjects to go and trade and reside \"in British<br>Colonies,\" and to enter into \"engagements with<br>British subjects for that purpose.\"",
          "It interfered with aliens as well as trade and<br>commerce, which cannot subsist among nations<br>without personal intercourse, which such an Act<br>(as far as China was concerned) would have a<br>tendency to prohibit.",
          "It is a great assumption of power on the part of a<br>Province to pass laws, the effect of which must be<br>practically to expel a particular class of aliens<br>from that Province, to say in effect that it will<br>by its legislation impede or prevent that class<br>from being employed in another Province—say the<br>North-west Territory or Manitoba—where railway<br>works may be languishing for want of that very<br>class of labourers, British Columbia being the<br>only sea-board of Canada on the Pacific through<br>which (in face of the restrictive laws of the<br>United States) that class of labourers can enter<br>and pass through; that is, in fact, legislating on<br>all inter-provincial immigration; in other words,<br>such legislation is ultra vires, and so I<br>pronounce it; and adjudge accordingly, and quash<br>the conviction, with costs.",
          "It is an infraction of the existing treaties<br>between the Imperial Government and China.",
          "It is enough to add that \"any person,\" no matter<br>whether white or Chinese, imprisoned in respect of<br>any infraction of the provisions of the Act, may<br>be at the will of the executive, subjected even to<br>hard labour.",
          "It is impossible but that such an imposition so<br>enforced, in addition to all the general taxes to<br>which he is subject, should make this country too<br>hot for him to live in; and just in proportion as<br>he is so persecuted out of the country, in that<br>degree does this enactment interfere with trade<br>and commerce and that control over aliens<br>exclusively given to the Dominion.",
          "It is shewn that he did not personally examine a<br>single Chinaman or inquire if he was “an infected<br>or exposed person.”",
          "It was his opinion that every one should be<br>examined who comes from China or from any<br>\"infected port.",
          "Its object, though not apparent on the face of the<br>Act, was to prevent Chinese coming into the<br>Province and drive out those who had already come.",
          "Legislation as to aliens is reserved to the<br>Dominion.",
          "No; an act or default of a stranger, a man whose<br>language he knows not, and for every infraction of<br>the Act by the Chinese under his employ.",
          "Now this assumes, as Dr. Davie assumed, that<br>Hongkong, although a British port and subject to<br>quarantine regulations, was (which includes the<br>time of the steamer's departure) and is a cradle<br>of small pox, and that every ship coming thence to<br>Victoria, especially with Chinese on board, should<br>be subject to the most searching examination, and<br>the drastic treatment I have described.",
          "Now, applying this test to the statute before us,<br>let us see whether and how far its provisions<br>affect, as is alleged, aliens, or trade, or<br>commerce.",
          "Opponents to the Act might as well contend the<br>exclusion of the Chinese from the franchise, and<br>barring them from acquiring lands, was illegal.",
          "So far, I have dealt with the Act on its own<br>merits; but if we consider it in juxtaposition to<br>the Dominion Act recently passed restricting the<br>Chinese throughout all Canada, its illegality<br>becomes transparent; for in passing that Act<br>against the Chinese the Dominion has spoken by the<br>highest authority which it possesses—its own<br>Parliament.",
          "Still both Federal Governments have reserved to<br>themselves the regulation of trade and commerce<br>and naturalization and aliens; so the analogy is<br>so close as to become almost a direct authority.",
          "Sub-section 2 of section 91 gives to the Dominion<br>Parliament exclusively the regulation of “trade<br>and commerce,” and by sub-section 25 that of<br>“naturalization and aliens,” and everything<br>relating to those subjects as affecting the whole<br>Dominion is within the Dominion powers, and no<br>local Legislature can make any statute interfering<br>with either of those subjects.",
          "That certainly is interfering with aliens.",
          "That it interfered with the Dominion powers under<br>the B. N. A. Act over aliens and naturalization.",
          "That it interfered with the Dominion powers under<br>the B. N. A. Act, aliens, and naturalization; 2nd.",
          "That small pox must have been in China on the 19th<br>April last, the date when the Empress left<br>Hongkong, as it was always there.",
          "That the Chinese might be taxed as other<br>residents, but could not be set apart as special<br>objects of the taxation, and be compelled to<br>contribute to the revenue of the State in the<br>character of foreigners.",
          "That there was danger of infection from white<br>passengers, but not the same danger as from<br>Chinamen.\"",
          "The Act is found associated with another Act now<br>disallowed, the express object of which is to<br>prevent the Chinese altogether from coming to this<br>country, and the principle \"noscitur a sociis\" is<br>kept up by the preamble of the present Act, which<br>describes the Chinese in terms which, I venture to<br>think, have never before in any other country<br>found a place in an Act of Parliament.",
          "The Act is so full of provisions that interfere<br>directly with aliens, with trade, and with<br>commerce, that I have no hesitation in pronouncing<br>all such provisions, and among them those under<br>which the appellant in this case has been<br>convicted, to be ultra vires the local<br>legislature, and consequently illegal and void.",
          "The California cases (see The People v. Naglee, 1<br>Cal. 232) decided a differential tax might be<br>imposed on foreign miners; and though a later case<br>(Lin Sing v. Washburn, 20 Cal. 334) had decided a<br>special tax could not be imposed on Chinese, a<br>most celebrated Judge, Mr. Justice Field (since<br>elevated to the Federal bench), dissented, and had<br>pointed out that according to federal decisions<br>the State might impose special taxation on alien<br>residents, provided the impost was not levied<br>against foreigners landing in the country.",
          "The Chinamen had already been examined on board<br>the ship by the Dominion Quarantine Officers and<br>Provincial officers and passed.",
          "The Chinese are chiefly dressed in woollen<br>materials and these harbour infection for weeks<br>and months.",
          "The Dominion under the B. N. A. Act had alone the<br>right of performing in Canada the obligations of<br>Canada as part of the British Empire in respect of<br>treaties, and although Canada might pass laws<br>prohibiting immigration, or having that tendency,<br>the Province could not do so, nor could it pass<br>laws in derogation of treaties.",
          "The action is one nominally rather than really,<br>for damages against Dr. George Duncan, the Health<br>Officer of the City of Victoria, on account of an<br>alleged excess of duty in despatching en masse,<br>without examination or enquiry, a number of<br>Chinamen out to the suspect station at Ross Bay,<br>there to be disinfected and scrubbed.",
          "The aliens in this case being Chinese, the first<br>enquiry must be, what is the object of the Act?",
          "The amount of business transacted by Chinamen in<br>British Columbia, as revealed by the tables in<br>that Chinese Report, is something which a casual<br>observer would have no idea of.",
          "The basis, then, of our enquiry must be: Is this<br>Chinese Regulation Act of 1884—rather the parts of<br>it objected to—within the limit of subjects and<br>area of section 92, or does it exceed those limits<br>in which it is supreme, and interfere with aliens,<br>trade and commerce in such a manner as to encroach<br>on section 91 or any of its sub-sections?",
          "The case was tried before a jury upon the issue<br>whether Hongkong, the last port the steamer left<br>in China, was or not “an infected locality.”",
          "The grounds alleged by the Health Officer for this<br>arbitrary treatment is “that China is an infected<br>locality,” and all persons coming from China and<br>especially in this instance Hongkong, and<br>especially also the natives of China, come from an<br>infected locality, and that he has that authority<br>under the Health By-Law, 1893, which was passed at<br>the time of the small pox panic in Victoria, and,<br>in all he did, was simply doing his duty.",
          "The law did not deal with the conditions under<br>which aliens might acquire rights or become<br>subjects of Her Majesty.",
          "The occasion was the arrival of the Empress of<br>China at the Outer Wharf, which is within the city<br>limits of Victoria, on the 1st day of May, 1894,<br>from China and Hongkong.",
          "The only evidence of Hong Kong being a place<br>infected, etc., was that of a medical man resident<br>in Victoria, who said \"That in China small pox was<br>endemic, because there inoculation was the<br>universal practice.",
          "The palpable object of such a provision, or set of<br>provisions, is to render the employment of Chinese<br>so distasteful and annoying to the employer that<br>he must cease to employ them.",
          "The plaintiff and other Chinamen similarly<br>situated obtained a writ of Habeas Corpus, upon<br>which they were discharged from this custody.",
          "The power asserted in the Act in question (the<br>California Act) is the right of the State to<br>prescribe the terms upon which the Chinese shall<br>be permitted to reside in it, and be so used as to<br>cut off all intercourse between them and the<br>people of the State, and defeat the commercial<br>policy of the nation.",
          "The provisions of the Act I have given somewhat in<br>extenso bear out that view, and the concurrent and<br>previous local legislation bear out the same<br>impression, for on the same day as this Act was<br>passed, another Act was passed, the very object of<br>which was plainly stated to be \"to prevent the<br>immigration\" of Chinese.\"",
          "The reports of the higher California courts are of<br>great authority for us on all Chinese questions,<br>for there have been efforts for years past to<br>restrict Chinese immigration in California, and<br>the matter has been constantly before the superior<br>courts there, and the judges there (if we may take<br>the reports as correct) are more than ordinarily<br>skilled in laying down the law correctly in<br>constitutional points of that nature.",
          "The same provisions that apply to Chinese may be<br>made to apply also to Americans, Frenchmen,<br>Germans, or any other foreigners.",
          "The tax was not to exclude the Chinese — another<br>statute with that object had been disallowed.",
          "The treaties I have quoted between Great Britain<br>and China, binding on the Dominion and on us in<br>British Columbia, secure to the Chinese, just as<br>the treaties between Great Britain and other<br>foreign countries secure to other foreigners, the<br>same rights in regard to the equality of taxation<br>which I have described as being enjoyed by<br>citizens of this country.",
          "The treaties between Great Britain and China,<br>which bind us, have been quoted.",
          "The treaty of 25th August, 1842, *Hertslet*, Vol.<br>6, ratified 26th June, 1843, p. 221, and Lord<br>Elgin's treaty of October, 1860, authenticated<br>copies of which were produced in Court, secure to<br>Chinese coming into British dominions the same<br>\"full security for persons and property as<br>subjects of Her Majesty.\"",
          "The whole Act teems with special provisions which<br>affect not only Chinese, but their employers, with<br>obligations and liabilities as to the conduct of<br>the Chinese in their employ, that no reasonable<br>man would encounter, and run the risk of the penal<br>consequences which the Act hangs over him.",
          "There was danger of infection from white<br>passengers, but not the same danger as from<br>Chinamen.",
          "There were several other diseases to be guarded<br>against from China, e.g., cholera, leprosy, etc.",
          "Thereupon the present action was brought to test<br>if and how far Chinamen are to be treated, when<br>they land on our shores, differently from other<br>foreigners.",
          "What is that but interfering with aliens, trade,<br>and commerce?",
