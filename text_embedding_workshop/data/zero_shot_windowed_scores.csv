The Attorney-General in support of the conviction said there were five points raised on the rule for the certiorari against the validity of the $10 tax.—1st. That it interfered with the Dominion powers under the B. N. A. Act, aliens, and naturalization; 2nd. Trade and commerce; 3rd. Treaty obligations; 4th. That the tax was unequal, and 5th. It was indirect taxation. As to the first point aliens were as much subject to taxation as citizens.",0.16553831100463867,0.39714497327804565,0.4373166859149933

Protection and taxation were reciprocal (Cooley on Taxation, p. 14). The law did not deal with the conditions under which aliens might acquire rights or become subjects of Her Majesty. Secondly—Trade and commerce were not interfered with. The object of the Act was two-fold, the police and sanitary regulation of a numerous foreign element, and the raising of revenue necessary to meet that regulation (Hodge v. The Queen, L. R. 9, App. Cas. 117). If incidentally trade and commerce were touched, the provincial power of direct taxation was not impaired (Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons, L. R. 7 App. Cas. 108). The preamble and scope of the Act showed its objects were purely matters of the police and raising of revenue to meet the necessary expenditure, and within “Direct Taxation.” Thirdly—The treaty obligations of England did not affect the question.",0.3020363450050354,0.44201621413230896,0.25594741106033325

[UNK] thirdly [UNK] the treaty obligations of england did not affect the question. The last communication from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor-General, dated 16th May, 1884, stated, in effect, that the Colonies with responsible government could pass restrictive laws irrespective of treaties (B. C. Sessional Papers, 1885, p. 464), and instanced the legislation of the Australian Colonies and of the Dominion. Fourthly—As to unequal taxation, the power of the Province within its jurisdiction was supreme and as plenary as that of the Imperial Parliament (R. v. Burah, L.R. 3 App. Cas. 904; R. v. Hodge, L.

If its object were successful and Chinese driven from the country, the customs dues received from the Chinese would be lost and the benefits of trade relations enjoyed by the merchants would be destroyed.

He cited the British treaty (25th August, 1842, from *Hertslet*, Vol. 6, and Lord *Elgin's* treaty, 1860), comparing it with the *Burlingame* treaty of the United States, and quoted California decisions (*Lin Sing v.

Inherent in and incidental to the taxing power was the characteristic of equality. *Cooley* stated that irrespective of constitutional limitation a particular class of citizens could not be burdened for the advantage of others—*Cooley's Constitutional Limitations*, p. 635. This was a principle underlying the power to tax and governing that right even though the CREASE, J. 1885. REGINA v.

The Australian Colonies were autonomous, and occupied the same position as that of Canada. The Provinces were not autonomous. He did not contend that the whole of the Act was invalid. Much of it was within the scope of the Province, notably the provisions affecting the size of dwellings, the forbidding the use of opium, and the desecration of grave-yards. He insisted that imposing excessive taxation on one class of citizens was unconstitutional. The remarks of Chief Justice Ritchie, in the case of Jonas v. Gilbert before the Supreme Court of Canada, were obiter dicta, as the decision was upon another point, and intimated, but did not decide the right of the Provinces to discriminate, nor in what things and to what extent discrimination in taxation was legitimate. Lastly, the Act was for indirect taxation, which was a power given only to the Dominion Parliament.",0.28284958004951477,0.30213987827301025,0.4150104522705078

It was a license fee, the power to impose which had, in Severn v. The Queen, been decided against the Provinces on the score of such legislation being against trade and commerce. The Attorney-General in reply—The ten dollar impost was a tax whether designated by the name of a licence or otherwise. The distinction between direct and indirect taxation was well drawn in the case of Reed v. Mousseau before the Supreme Court of Canada, in which Mr. Justice Strong mentioned the Privy Council had decided the Provincial legislatures had exclusive power to impose direct taxation, and that it did not follow they might not have power even to impose indirect taxation. The tax did not sanction the carrying on of any business out of the product of which the consumer would, indirectly, contribute towards payment of the tax.",0.2842026650905609,0.37341827154159546,0.34237900376319885

Then as to inequality, the one dictum of Cooley was but an expression of opinion that political wisdom required uniform taxation; for the same author cited numerous authorities, including that of the Supreme Court of the United States establishing the right to discriminate unless fettered by the express language of the Constitution. Todd on Parliamentary Government in the Colonies, supported the view that the Provinces within their jurisdiction were as omnipotent as the Imperial Parliament. The California cases (see The People v. Naglee, 1 Cal. 232) decided a differential tax might be imposed on foreign miners; and though a later case (Lin Sing v.

The tax was not to exclude the Chinese — another statute with that object had been disallowed. It was imposed to meet the extraordinary expenses incident to enforcing the police and sanitary regulations prescribed by the Act. The question of treaties had nothing to do with the subject, for to responsible governments the Imperial Authorities conceded the right to pass laws within their jurisdiction.

It starts with a recital, in itself a petio principii—not apparently the result of any public enquiry—which charges them with being not law-abiding, dissimilar in habits and occupation to the whites—useless in emergencies, habitual desecrators of grave-yards, unsuited to our laws, and of habits subversive of the community.",0.021943412721157074,0.16888868808746338,0.8091679215431213

The only schedule is the form of license, which runs as follows:—

The question now raised on the construction of this Act affects not only British Columbia, but, as she occupies the only Pacific seaboard of the Dominion, indirectly more or less the very many other Provinces under the flag of confederation. Taking for convenience the five points of objection to the conviction in the order in which they are made— 
1. That it interfered with the Dominion powers under the B. N. A. Act over aliens and naturalization. 2. Trade and commerce. 3. Treaty obligations. 4. That the tax was unequal. 5. That it was indirect taxation and therefore illegal, and should be quashed.",0.09258074313402176,0.08323202282190323,0.8241872191429138

On the first point, I would observe that it is now well settled law that British Columbia, as a part of the Dominion, possesses all, but possesses only, the powers which are strictly defined by the B. N. A. Act of 1867, which is, indeed, the constitution of Canada. Neither she nor any other of the Provinces possess any other powers of legislation than are conferred by that Act. If British Columbia, or any other Province, in its legislation, goes beyond that Act and in excess of its provisions, that moment, and to the extent of such transgression, it ceases to be law. Therefore, in dealing with this question, our constitutional Act must be kept in view throughout, as the measure by which we must continually gauge the legality or illegality of the provisions of the local statute under consideration.",0.33787432312965393,0.3175275921821594,0.34459811449050903

The Act of Federation was passed in order to be an irrefragable, permanent standard by which to preserve and regulate all the relative rights of the Provinces, as among themselves and as regards the Dominion. The exclusive powers of that Act given to the Dominion over particular subjects are contained in the 91st section. The exclusive powers of the Province are particularized in section 92. It is natural that in the working out of such a constitution in a new and growing country, questions should be continually cropping up, and call upon the Courts to define gradually and with greater exactness, as time progresses and population expands, the relative powers given by the Act to the Dominion and Provinces respectively.",0.4585798382759094,0.2386527955532074,0.30276739597320557
Crease,"working out of such a constitution in a new and growing country, questions should be continually cropping up, and call upon the courts to define gradually and with greater exactness, as time progresses and population expands, the relative powers given by the act to the dominion and provinces respectively. Sub-section 2 of section 91 gives to the Dominion Parliament exclusively the regulation of “trade and commerce,” and by sub-section 25 that of “naturalization and aliens,” and everything relating to those subjects as affecting the whole Dominion is within the Dominion powers, and no local Legislature can make any statute interfering with either of those subjects. If it does, so far as such interference extends it is illegal and void, and when brought before the Court it is the duty of that tribunal so to adjudge it. And the converse of this is true when applied to Dominion legislation as affecting the subjects exclusively given by the constitution to the Province. Now, applying this test to the statute before us, let us see whether and how far its provisions affect, as is alleged, aliens, or trade, or commerce.

On applying to the preamble, we find that it looks like a bill of indictment as against a race not suited to live among a civilized nation, and certainly does not prepare one for legislation which would encourage or tolerate their settlement in the country. Indeed, the first lines of the preamble sound an alarm at the multitude of people coming in, who are of the repulsive habits described in the last part of the preamble, and prepares one for measures which should have a tendency to abate that alarm by deterrent influences and enactments which should have the effect of materially lessening the number of such undesirable visitors.",0.05389190837740898,0.25129830837249756,0.6948097348213196

And the grounds of this decision were that the federal constitution had vested in the general government the power to regulate commerce in all its branches (as with us in the Dominion); and this power extends to every species of commercial intercourse, and may be exercised upon persons as well as property (Mr. Justice Field, whose arguments have been reproduced by the Attorney-General before me in this case, dissenting). That commerce cannot be carried on without the agency of persons, and the tax, the effect of which is to diminish personal intercourse, is a tax on commerce.

That the Act could not be maintained as a police regulation; that a branch of the police power had been surrendered to the Federal Government as a part of the power to regulate commerce, and its exercise by a State was incompatible with the authority of the Government.

The reports of the higher California courts are of great authority for us on all Chinese questions, for there have been efforts for years past to restrict Chinese immigration in California, and the matter has been constantly before the superior courts there, and the judges there (if we may take the reports as correct) are more than ordinarily skilled in laying down the law correctly in constitutional points of that nature. Indeed, there is no other country which has such experience generally in constitutional law as applicable to a federation of states. Of course, in all the observations I make I recognize the now well-known distinction between the relations of a State of the Union to the Federal Government, and our relation as a Province to the Dominion.

Gazette of April 20, 1893) directs a strict examination to be made of any vessel and persons coming from “an infected locality,” before any person, luggage or freight or other thing is allowed to be landed from it.",0.11791372299194336,0.062345653772354126,0.8197405934333801

He considered “China the home of small pox,” and that it was “an infected place”; that, in China, small pox was “endemic,” i.e., always there; because there “inoculation” was the universal practice and was a constant source of danger; that in England and Europe and America, generally, vaccination, of late years, has been the rule. That was a preventative, and persons from such places were naturally not so much the object of suspicion or inspection to a health officer.

When asked the question, ""Would you allow Chinamen to land and go into the city?"" the Doctor replied, ""The whole of the baggage should be disinfected, on the steamer if possible—if not, on the Outer Wharf.

He was of Judgment opinion that the whole of those landed should be disinfected. The Chinese are chiefly dressed in woollen materials and these harbour infection for weeks and months. The period of incubation of small pox was from twelve to fifteen days. Cases of small pox were found in all large seaport towns, as for instance Liverpool; but these were not ""endemic.""

It goes further and shews that the only person to be ""dealt with in such manner as the Medical Health City Officer shall direct"" is ""any infected or exposed person from on board,"" under none of which categories do the plaintiff or other Chinamen, seized and carted off on this occasion, happen to come.

2nd. Is the tax imposed in order to raise a Municipal revenue, or is it imposed for any other purpose ? e.g. for restriction or suppression, total or partial.

The present Municipal Amendment Act, 1885, partakes of both natures, and the ordinary rule must I think be observed, viz., the subjects of the ""other licenses "" mentioned in sub-section 9 must have at least somewhat besides taxability (from which quality no Act or thing is exempt) in common with ""shops, taverns, saloons or auctioneers.""",0.337287962436676,0.38335856795310974,0.2793534994125366

The opinion, therefore, of the majority of the Judges in Severn's case, seems more probable. There must I think be some limitation placed on the licensing power by the word "" other."" Mr. Yates argued from even that point of view these laundries were taxable, for that the laundry men though they were very certainly not keeping shops, were very analogus to auctioneers.

In other words, this menial and poorly paid occupation may be taxed fifteen times the annual amount which the statute permits to be imposed on the most extensive grocery or dry goods store.

This is an application for a mandamus to the Corporation of the City of Victoria, ordering them to issue a renewal of a pawnbroker's license to the prosecutors. The reason alleged by the Corporation for their refusal is that they have passed a resolution stating that in their opinion the prosecutors are not fit persons to be the recipients of such a license.",0.32107383012771606,0.30228355526924133,0.376642644405365

It is alleged by the prosecution, and not denied, that the Council have in fact ordered the Collector to issue no pawnbroking license to any Chinaman. And the proposition was broadly advanced before me that the Provincial Legislature have the right to eliminate nationalities or individuals from the capacity to receive these trade licenses : and that they have, in conformity with Regina v. Hodge, delegated to the Council authority to exercise that right. The first of these contentions has already been before this Court, and has, I think, been entirely denied by several Judges now on the bench. In the first place by Mr. Justice Gray, in Tai Sing v. Macguire (1 B.C.R. pt. i. 101, 1878): by Mr. Justice Crease in Wing Fong's case (1 B.C.R. pt. ii.",0.1302572786808014,0.1613195836544037,0.7084231376647949

These decisions have never been appealed, and I do not feel at liberty to disregard them. I must, therefore, assume that no such authority exists in the Provincial Legislature, and therefore it is impossible that they could have delegated it, or conferred it on the Council. Evidently, if such a power existed, then, since no man may in any municipality pursue any avocation without such license, the Local Legislature might exclude large classes of men from gaining a livelihood, or indeed existing in the Province-a very wide interference with ""trade and commerce,"" which is totally removed from their control by the B.

This was, in the argument before me, entirely based on the permissive form adopted in the Statute (""Municipal Act, 1887,"" c. 16, s. 104). "" The municipality shall have power to issue licenses "" for the trades and professions enumerated, including pawnbrokers (sub-s. 10), ""and to levy and collect by means of such licenses the amounts"" therein specified. And stress was laid on the word "" license,"" as intimating a permission ; without which antecedent license or permission the proposing trader could not lawfully commence business (ss. 112, 113). But these words do not imply any discretion, i. e., authority to grant or refuse.

The only instances in which some antecedent certificate of fitness or qualification is required are, I think, liquor dealers, medical men, and barristers and solicitors. These also have to take out annual licenses under the Municipality Act. But special tribunals are appointed to judge antecedently of their fitness. And, I think, it is quite unheard of that the Council should arbitrarily assume to refuse a license to any of these classes, or to volunteer any statement of their opinion of the fitness or unfitness of a doctor or solicitor. If the Council is to have an absolute discretion to refuse a license to any person applying, on the ground of what they choose to allege as unfitness, then half a dozen tradesmen may secure themselves an entire monopoly of their respective trades throughout the municipality, by simply voting that in their opinion each proposing competitor is an unfit person.",0.31482046842575073,0.24476931989192963,0.44041022658348083

But if the least attention be bestowed on the Statute, it will be seen that the Legislature has given no discretion to the Council. The Statute does not even say they may ""grant "" licenses ; but only that they may issue them. The industrial classes are told, "" You may not carry on your trade in the municipality without a license; if you ask where to get a license, we have authorized the municipality to issue it on payment to them of the annual amount fixed by by-law.""

It was alleged that the occupation of a pawnbroker affords peculiar facilities for the concealment of stolen goods and the escape of criminals, and that it is particularly essential that care should be exercised

in the selection of persons to carry it on. It is, however, for the Legislature to speak on such a subject, and it has spoken. There are special laws relating to pawnbrokers. The business, it is true, is not, to most persons, attractive. A pawnbroker deals always with the needy, occasionally with the criminal classes: he must generally be hard, and always usurious. But he has always been considered a necessary evil. There has never, so far as I know, been placed any limit on their number, any more than on the number of bakers or butchers. It has been deemed sufficient to make special laws in respect to them and their books, and the supervision of the police.",0.37565532326698303,0.2942635416984558,0.33008116483688354

But so, also, are there many special laws for the inspection of butchers' shops under the Health Acts, and of grocers, and bakers, and milk dealers, and in fact of all traders, under the Weights and Measures Acts and the Adulteration Acts; and a reference to the London Police Courts will show that many classes of tradesmen far surpass the pawnbrokers in the number and importance of the charges against them before the stipendiary magistrates. In fact, the pawnbroker assists the detection of criminals perhaps as often as he defeats it, and is a most useful ally of the police. It is not uninteresting to note the uniformity with which the same events result from the same principles, although in very different parts of the world.

In the French colony of Cayenne, the Town Council recently handicapped the superior capacities of the Chinaman by imposing on merchants of that empire an extra tax of $300 per annum, deeming it also expedient to handicap English and German traders by a surtax of $200 on them. But on an appeal to the Courts at Paris, all these impositions were declared null on the very same principles as those on which the Courts here insisted when they decided the cases above referred to, viz., as being infringements at once of personal liberty, and of the equality of all men before the law, and also negation of international rights. The prosecutors are entitled to their writ, and as the law on the subject has been quite clearly laid down ten years ago by Mr. Justice Gray, and again and again by other Judges, the defendants must pay all costs.
