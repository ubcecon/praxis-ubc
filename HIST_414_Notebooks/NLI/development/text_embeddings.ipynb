         "CREASE, J. 1885. REGINA v. WING CHONG. \r\n\r\n14th & 15th July, Certiorari—“Chinese Regulation Act, 1884,” s. 5—Constitutionality—B.N.A. Act, 1867, ss. 91, 92—“Aliens”—“Trade and Commerce”—Taxation. \r\nOn the return to a writ of certiorari. Held, that the “Chinese Regulation Act, 1884,” is ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature, on the following grounds: \r\n1. It is an interference with the rights of Aliens. \r\n2. It is an interference with Trade and Commerce. \r\n3. It is an infraction of the existing treaties between the Imperial Government and China. \r\n4. It imposes unequal taxation. \r\n\r\n14th & 15th July—On the return of a writ of certiorari directed to Edwin Johnson, Esquire, Police Magistrate for the City of Victoria, to return into this Court a certain conviction made by him under which one Wing Chong was fined $20 for not having in his possession a license issued under the “Chinese Regulation Act, 1884.”\r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General in support of the conviction said there were five points raised on the rule for the certiorari against the validity of the $10 tax.—1st. That it interfered with the Dominion powers under the B. N. A. Act, aliens, and naturalization; 2nd. Trade and commerce; 3rd. Treaty obligations; 4th. That the tax was unequal, and 5th. It was indirect taxation. As to the first point aliens were as much subject to taxation as citizens. Protection and taxation were reciprocal (Cooley on Taxation, p. 14). The law did not deal with the conditions under which aliens might acquire rights or become subjects of Her Majesty. Secondly—Trade and commerce were not interfered with. The object of the Act was two-fold, the police and sanitary regulation of a numerous foreign element, and the raising of revenue necessary to meet that regulation (Hodge v. The Queen, L. R. 9, App. Cas. 117). If incidentally trade and commerce were touched, the provincial power of direct taxation was not impaired (Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons, L. R. 7 App. Cas. 108). The preamble and scope of the Act showed its objects were purely matters of the police and raising of revenue to meet the necessary expenditure, and within “Direct Taxation.” Thirdly—The treaty obligations of England did not affect the question. The last communication from the Secretary of State for the Colonies to the Governor-General, dated 16th May, 1884, stated, in effect, that the Colonies with responsible government could pass restrictive laws irrespective of treaties (B. C. Sessional Papers, 1885, p. 464), and instanced the legislation of the Australian Colonies and of the Dominion. Fourthly—As to unequal taxation, the power of the Province within its jurisdiction was supreme and as plenary as that of the Imperial Parliament (R. v. Burah, L.R. 3 App. Cas. 904; R. v. Hodge, L. R. 9, App. Cas. 117; and Powell v. Apollo Candle Co., L.R. 10 App. Cas., p. 290; and *In re Goodhue*, 19 Gr. 366); *Cooley* on Taxation, pp. 3, 82, 126-128, and *Cooley's Constitutional Limitations* (5th Ed.) 626-7; *Sedgwick* on Stat. (2nd Ed.), p. 501; *Potter's Dwarris* 418, 421, 425; *Dow v. Black*, L. R. 6 P. C. 272, were cited as showing the power of taxation, unless abridged by the written constitution, might be exercised so as to discriminate. The Supreme Court of Canada, in the case of *Jonas v. Gilbert*, 5 S. C. R., 356, had practically decided the same point. Fifthly—Whether called a licence or not, the imposition was a direct poll tax, and as such came within the power of the Province to raise money by direct taxation for Provincial purposes. *Cooley* on Taxation, 386; *Wharton's Law Lexicon*; *Reed v. Mousseau*, 8 S. C. R., 408. It was not a license to carry on business, or a method whereby indirectly money was raised from the consumer, as, for instance, customs or stamp laws.\r\n\r\n*Richards*, Q. C., for Wing Chong—The object of the Act was not for police purposes or to raise revenue. Its object, though not apparent on the face of the Act, was to prevent Chinese coming into the Province and drive out those who had already come. He reviewed the legislation against Chinese since confederation, contending it was levelled against a particular race of aliens and, therefore, beyond provincial control, per *Gwynne*, J., in *Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons*, 4 S. C. R., at p. 346. The law was a direct interference with trade and commerce (*R. v. Severn*, 2 Can. S. C. R., 70). If its object were successful and Chinese driven from the country, the customs dues received from the Chinese would be lost and the benefits of trade relations enjoyed by the merchants would be destroyed. Counsel cited statistics from the Chinese Commission showing the extreme importance, from a fiscal and commercial point of view, of the large number of Chinese in the Province. The Dominion under the B. N. A. Act had alone the right of performing in Canada the obligations of Canada as part of the British Empire in respect of treaties, and although Canada might pass laws prohibiting immigration, or having that tendency, the Province could not do so, nor could it pass laws in derogation of treaties. He cited the British treaty (25th August, 1842, from *Hertslet*, Vol. 6, and Lord *Elgin's* treaty, 1860), comparing it with the *Burlingame* treaty of the United States, and quoted California decisions (*Lin Sing v. Washburn*, 20 Cal. 334), and the decision of *Gray*, J., in *Tai Sing v. Maguire*, deciding that similar legislation was held void as contravening the treaty and the sovereign power to regulate trade and commerce with foreign countries. \r\n\r\n*Drake*, Q. C., on the same side, argued that the imposition of the $10 tax was invalid because of inequality. Inherent in and incidental to the taxing power was the characteristic of equality. *Cooley* stated that irrespective of constitutional limitation a particular class of citizens could not be burdened for the advantage of others—*Cooley's Constitutional Limitations*, p. 635. This was a principle underlying the power to tax and governing that right even though the CREASE, J. 1885. REGINA v. WING CHONG. written constitution made no mention of it—Cooley on Taxation, p. 18, and City of Lexington v. McQuillan, 35 Am. Dec. 159. The imposition was in derogation of treaty rights with which Canada alone had the power to deal. The Australian legislation did not help the contention of the Attorney-General. The Australian Colonies were autonomous, and occupied the same position as that of Canada. The Provinces were not autonomous. He did not contend that the whole of the Act was invalid. Much of it was within the scope of the Province, notably the provisions affecting the size of dwellings, the forbidding the use of opium, and the desecration of grave-yards. He insisted that imposing excessive taxation on one class of citizens was unconstitutional. The remarks of Chief Justice Ritchie, in the case of Jonas v. Gilbert before the Supreme Court of Canada, were obiter dicta, as the decision was upon another point, and intimated, but did not decide the right of the Provinces to discriminate, nor in what things and to what extent discrimination in taxation was legitimate. Lastly, the Act was for indirect taxation, which was a power given only to the Dominion Parliament. It was a license fee, the power to impose which had, in Severn v. The Queen, been decided against the Provinces on the score of such legislation being against trade and commerce. \r\n\r\nThe Attorney-General in reply—The ten dollar impost was a tax whether designated by the name of a licence or otherwise. The distinction between direct and indirect taxation was well drawn in the case of Reed v. Mousseau before the Supreme Court of Canada, in which Mr. Justice Strong mentioned the Privy Council had decided the Provincial legislatures had exclusive power to impose direct taxation, and that it did not follow they might not have power even to impose indirect taxation. The tax did not sanction the carrying on of any business out of the product of which the consumer would, indirectly, contribute towards payment of the tax. Then as to inequality, the one dictum of Cooley was but an expression of opinion that political wisdom required uniform taxation; for the same author cited numerous authorities, including that of the Supreme Court of the United States establishing the right to discriminate unless fettered by the express language of the Constitution. Todd on Parliamentary Government in the Colonies, supported the view that the Provinces within their jurisdiction were as omnipotent as the Imperial Parliament. The California cases (see The People v. Naglee, 1 Cal. 232) decided a differential tax might be imposed on foreign miners; and though a later case (Lin Sing v. Washburn, 20 Cal. 334) had decided a special tax could not be imposed on Chinese, a most celebrated Judge, Mr. Justice Field (since elevated to the Federal bench), dissented, and had pointed out that according to federal decisions the State might impose special taxation on alien residents, provided the impost was not levied against foreigners landing in the country. The tax was not to exclude the Chinese — another statute with that object had been disallowed. It was imposed to meet the extraordinary expenses incident to enforcing the police and sanitary regulations prescribed by the Act. The question of treaties had nothing to do with the subject, for to responsible governments the Imperial Authorities conceded the right to pass laws within their jurisdiction. So the Canadian Parliament to-day was passing a restriction Act. Opponents to the Act might as well contend the exclusion of the Chinese from the franchise, and barring them from acquiring lands, was illegal. As to autonomy, neither the Australian Colonies nor the Dominion were absolutely possessed, but the Province equally with Australia and the Dominion were autonomous within the bounds of their respective jurisdictions. \r\n\r\n21st August, 1885—CREASE, J.— In order to deal satisfactorily with the questions raised by this appeal, it is necessary to see what is the scope and purport of the Act. It is called \"An Act to regulate the Chinese population of British Columbia.\" It starts with a recital, in itself a petio principii—not apparently the result of any public enquiry—which charges them with being not law-abiding, dissimilar in habits and occupation to the whites—useless in emergencies, habitual desecrators of grave-yards, unsuited to our laws, and of habits subversive of the community. From that premises concluding that special laws are required for their government, it proceeds to enact:— \r\n\r\n1. The title.\r\n\r\n2. Defines Chinese to mean \"any native of the Chinese empire or \"its dependencies not born of British parents, and shall include any \"person of the Chinese race.\" \r\n\r\nSection 3—with which we are immediately concerned—says:—\"From and after the passage of this Act there shall be payable and \"paid by every Chinese in British Columbia, above the age of fourteen years, unto and for the use of Her Majesty, her heirs and successors, the sum of ten dollars, and thereafter on the 1st day of June in \"each and every year there shall be likewise payable and paid by such \"Chinese person a further sum of ten dollars.\" \r\n\r\nSec. 4 provides for the appointment and payment of special collectors, \"to be called Chinese collectors, to collect and receive such \"payments from Chinese; and such collector or collectors, immediately upon such payment, shall issue and deliver to the person paying \"the same a licence in the form contained in the schedule hereto.\" \r\n\r\nBy Sec. 5 \"Any Chinese who shall be found within the Province \"not having in his possession a licence issued under the provisions of \"this Act, lawfully issued to him, shall, on conviction thereof, forfeit \"and pay a sum not exceeding forty dollars.\" \r\n\r\nBy Sec. 6 \"Any collector or Government servant wilfully disobeying \"any of the provisions of this Act shall forfeit and pay a sum not \"exceeding one hundred dollars.\" \r\n\r\nBy Sec. 7 \"Every collector shall collect the tax from each Chinese, \"and shall as soon afterwards as may be pay over the amount to the \"officer in charge of the Treasury, or to such other person as the \"Lieutenant-Governor in Council may from time to time direct.\"  \r\n\r\nBy Sec. 8 “Every employer of Chinese shall furnish to the collector “when requested by him so to do, from time to time, a list of all “Chinese in his employ, or indirectly employed by him; but no such “statement shall bind the collector, nor shall excuse him from “making due enquiry to ascertain its correctness.” \r\n\r\nSection 9. “In case any employer of Chinese fails to deliver to the “collector the list mentioned in the preceding section, when required “so to do, or knowingly states anything falsely therein, such “employer shall, on complaint of the collector and upon conviction “before a Justice of the Peace having jurisdiction within the “district wherein such employer carries on his business, forfeit “and pay a fine not exceeding one hundred dollars for every Chinese “in his employ, to be recovered by distress of the goods and chattels “of such employer failing to pay the same, or in lieu thereof shall be “liable to imprisonment for a period not less than one month and not “exceeding two calendar months.”\r\n\r\nSection 10 gives the collector power to “levy the amount of the license from any Chinese not being in lawful possession of a license, “with costs, by distress of his goods and chattels, or of any goods and “chattels which may be in the possession of the delinquent, or which “may be upon or in any premises (whether the goods of the delin- “quent or not) for the time being in the possession or occupation of “such delinquent Chinese,” and declares that “for the purposes of this “section premises shall be deemed to be in the possession or occupa- “tion of any Chinese when it can be shown to the satisfaction of the “tribunal having cognizance of the matter (a) that such Chinese “habitually frequents such premises with the assent of the owner ; “(b) that he is the owner or one of the owners of the premises, or has “control, either alone or jointly, with another or others, of such pre- “mises or some part thereof; (c) that he has passed the night or slept “upon such premises at any time within a week of the levy, it shall “be sufficient authority for the collector to levy as aforesaid on the “non-production of the license. Proof of the lawful possession of “such receipt shall lie on the person whose goods are restrained.” \r\n\r\nBy section 11 every license must be demanded by the employer and retained during the Chinaman’s service. \r\n\r\nBy section 12 tax collectors are not to allow Chinese to pass unless a license is produced. \r\n\r\nSection 13 imposes a penalty of $50 on any person guilty of employing any Chinese not having a license. \r\n\r\nSec. 14 Fee for free miner’s certificate to a Chinese to be $15, instead of the white man's $5. \r\n\r\nSec. 15. Penalty not exceeding $30 for every Chinaman mining without a license. \r\n\r\nSection 16 amends the License Ordinance of 1867, whereby the pursuit of various callings is sanctioned by the ominous words, “but no license shall be issued to any Chinese.” \r\n\r\nSections 17 and 18 prevent the exhumation of dead bodies without permission, and prohibit the use of opium except for medical purposes. \r\n\r\nSection 19 provides for the recovery of any pecuniary penalty thereunder in a summary manner before a J. P., and in default of immediate payment sanctions a distress, and failing that, imprisonment for not exceeding three months. \r\n\r\nSection 20 (amended by Act of 1885) declares that \"convictions are not to be quashed for want of form.\" \r\n\r\nSection 21. “Any Chinese who shall lend his license or free miner's \"certificate to another Chinese, and any Chinese who shall utter or \"pass off upon any collector or other person any license or free miner's \"certificate other than his own, with intent himself to avoid payment\" of the license fee payable under this Act (and the onus of proving “that such was not his intent shall rest upon the person charged), shall \"forfeit and pay a penalty of not less than twenty dollars nor more \"than one hundred dollars.\" \r\n\r\nSection 22 enacts that the tribunal applied to may decide \"on its own view and judgment\" whether any person is a Chinese or 14 years old. \r\n\r\nSections 23, 24 and 25 contain sanitary provisions affecting buildings let to Chinese. \r\n\r\nSection 26 provides a means whereby persons imprisoned for an infraction of the Act may be put to hard labour by an Order in Council, and the same executive authority is empowered to make rules and regulations for carrying out the Act. \r\n\r\nSection 27 places in the hand of the local executive the construction from time to time of further rules and regulations to enforce the Act, and a fitting summary to such a premiss in section 28 reverses all the old law of England and one of the most cherished and priceless safeguards of the freedom from oppression won for us by our forefathers—that no one shall be deemed guilty until he has been proved so—throws on the defendant, white or yellow, the burden of proving that he is exempt from the operation of its arbitrary provisions—and in a tax Act which is in restraint of personal liberty, and opposed to the common law rights of the citizen—for if applicable to aliens it is a fortiori to the temporary inhabitants of the Province—abrogates the hitherto invariable rule in criminal matters and makes it unnecessary in any information, summons or conviction to “state or negotiate any “exception in or exemption under this Act, or in contemplation of “law.” Taught by experience of former efforts in the same direction, section 29 gives one year’s notice of the coming into operation of the Act—a time which has now expired. And section 30 terms it merely “The Chinese Regulation Act, 1884.” \r\n\r\nThe only schedule is the form of license, which runs as follows:—\r\n\r\nThe question now raised on the construction of this Act affects not only British Columbia, but, as she occupies the only Pacific seaboard of the Dominion, indirectly more or less the very many other Provinces under the flag of confederation. \r\nTaking for convenience the five points of objection to the conviction in the order in which they are made— \r\n1. That it interfered with the Dominion powers under the B. N. A. Act over aliens and naturalization. \r\n2. Trade and commerce. \r\n3. Treaty obligations. \r\n4. That the tax was unequal. \r\n5. That it was indirect taxation and therefore illegal, and should be quashed. \r\n\r\nOn the first point, I would observe that it is now well settled law that British Columbia, as a part of the Dominion, possesses all, but possesses only, the powers which are strictly defined by the B. N. A. Act of 1867, which is, indeed, the constitution of Canada.\r\n\r\nNeither she nor any other of the Provinces possess any other powers of legislation than are conferred by that Act. If British Columbia, or any other Province, in its legislation, goes beyond that Act and in excess of its provisions, that moment, and to the extent of such transgression, it ceases to be law. Therefore, in dealing with this question, our constitutional Act must be kept in view throughout, as the measure by which we must continually gauge the legality or illegality of the provisions of the local statute under consideration. \r\n\r\nThe Act of Federation was passed in order to be an irrefragable, permanent standard by which to preserve and regulate all the relative rights of the Provinces, as among themselves and as regards the Dominion. \r\n\r\nThe exclusive powers of that Act given to the Dominion over particular subjects are contained in the 91st section. The exclusive powers of the Province are particularized in section 92. It is natural that in the working out of such a constitution in a new and growing country, questions should be continually cropping up, and call upon the Courts to define gradually and with greater exactness, as time progresses and population expands, the relative powers given by the Act to the Dominion and Provinces respectively. Sub-section 2 of section 91 gives to the Dominion Parliament exclusively the regulation of “trade and commerce,” and by sub-section 25 that of “naturalization and aliens,” and everything relating to those subjects as affecting the whole Dominion is within the Dominion powers, and no local Legislature can make any statute interfering with either of those subjects. If it does, so far as such interference extends it is illegal and void, and when brought before the Court it is the duty of that tribunal so to adjudge it.\r\n\r\nAnd the converse of this is true when applied to Dominion legislation as affecting the subjects exclusively given by the constitution to the Province. \r\n\r\nNow, applying this test to the statute before us, let us see whether and how far its provisions affect, as is alleged, aliens, or trade, or commerce. \r\n\r\nThe aliens in this case being Chinese, the first enquiry must be, what is the object of the Act? On applying to the preamble, we find that it looks like a bill of indictment as against a race not suited to live among a civilized nation, and certainly does not prepare one for legislation which would encourage or tolerate their settlement in the country. Indeed, the first lines of the preamble sound an alarm at the multitude of people coming in, who are of the repulsive habits described in the last part of the preamble, and prepares one for measures which should have a tendency to abate that alarm by deterrent influences and enactments which should have the effect of materially lessening the number of such undesirable visitors. The provisions of the Act I have given somewhat in extenso bear out that view, and the concurrent and previous local legislation bear out the same impression, for on the same day as this Act was passed, another Act was passed, the very object of which was plainly stated to be \"to prevent the immigration\" of Chinese.\" \r\n\r\nThat Act was disallowed. It interfered with aliens as well as trade and commerce, which cannot subsist among nations without personal intercourse, which such an Act (as far as China was concerned) would have a tendency to prohibit. \r\n\r\nAnother statute (of 1878), \"An Act to provide for the better collection of taxes from Chinese,\" which contained several of the stringent provisions which I have described in this Act, such as a special tax specially recoverable by summary and unusual remedies from the Chinese alone, in British Columbia, and enforced by fine and imprisonment and other penal clauses, came before this Court, and in a most conscientious and exhaustive judgment of Mr. Justice Gray, of 23rd September, 1878, in the case of Tai Sing v. Maguire, was declared unconstitutional and ultra vires the Local Legislature, as interfering with aliens and trade and commerce—matters reserved exclusively under the 81st section of the B. N. A. Act to the Dominion. That decision was never appealed from, and was at once acted on by the government as conclusive. \r\n\r\nThe position and legislative powers of British Columbia have been in no respect altered in its relations to the legislative powers of the Dominion on the same subjects since that time, though Russell v. The Queen (7 App. Cas. 829) and Hodge v. The Queen (9 App. Cas. 117) have more fully defined the extent of the powers of the Provincial Legislatures than has hitherto been done; and in the latter case especially. That decision, however, was not before Mr. Gray when he rendered the judgment in Tai Sing v. Maguire. Until reversed or varied, the decision in the Hodge case is law here, and binding on this Court. \r\n\r\nTheir lordships say (page 132), with reference to the objection of the appellants there (delegatus non potest delegare):—\r\n\"It appears to their lordships, however, that the objection thus raised by the appellants is founded on an entire misconception of the true character and position of the Provincial Legislatures. They are in no sense delegates of or acting under any mandate from the Imperial Parliament. When the British North America Act enacted that there should be a Legislature for Ontario\" (for this case we may for \"Ontario\" read \"British Columbia\"), \"and that its Legislative Assembly should have exclusive authority to make laws for the Province and for provincial purposes in relation to the matters enumerated in section 92, it conferred powers not in any sense to be exercised by delegation from or as agents of the Imperial Parliament, but authority as plenary and as ample within the limits prescribed by section 92 as the Imperial Parliament in the plenitude of its power possessed and could bestow. Within these limits of subjects and area the Local Legislature is supreme.\" \r\n\r\n[So far this decision confirms the words of Lord Selborne in R. v. Burah; what follows goes beyond it.] \"And has the same authority as the Imperial Parliament or the Parliament of the Dominion would have had under like circumstances to confide to a municipal institution or body of its own creation authority to make by-laws or resolutions as to subjects specified in the enactment, and with the object of carrying the enactment into operation and effect.\" \r\n\r\nThat decision, although in some respects an obiter dictum, as regards this case, makes it clear that within the limits of subjects and the area prescribed by the B. N. A. Act, by section 92, the Legislature of British Columbia is supreme. The basis, then, of our enquiry must be: Is this Chinese Regulation Act of 1884—rather the parts of it objected to—within the limit of subjects and area of section 92, or does it exceed those limits in which it is supreme, and interfere with aliens, trade and commerce in such a manner as to encroach on section 91 or any of its sub-sections? If so, so far as it does so, it is unconstitutional and ultra vires, and therefore void. Now it does not follow because a local Act touches on these three subjects it therefore interferes with them so as to render it unconstitutional. \r\n\r\nAliens may be taxed, may be subjected to the same rules and municipal and other by-laws as other inhabitants of British Columbia, and such discrimination in so doing as are allowed in local legislatures between and among different persons and occupations among the whites are quite as applicable to them. These are the only discriminations which the law allows, and these are the permissible discriminations spoken of by Cooley in the portions cited before the Court. During the argument the case of *Lin Sing v. Washburn*, 20 California Reports, 534, was quoted as bearing on this case. There, an Act of the California Legislature passed an Act imposing a capitation tax “on ‘each person, male and female, of the Mongolian race of the age of 18 years and upwards residing in the State,’ accompanying a license almost a *fac simile* of our own, and enforced in much the same way as in the case before us, that, after long and elaborate argument in which the Attorney-General appeared for the State, was determined to be unconstitutional, as it was an interference with trade and commerce, which could be regulated alone by the general government. It was in vain advanced that at least the State had concurrent jurisdiction in matters of taxation relative to its own internal affairs, of which this was one (the same proposition as was advanced by the Attorney-General in this case) in which it had a supreme and autonomous right to legislate. And the grounds of this decision were that the federal constitution had vested in the general government the power to regulate commerce in all its branches (as with us in the Dominion); and this power extends to every species of commercial intercourse, and may be exercised upon persons as well as property (Mr. Justice Field, whose arguments have been reproduced by the Attorney-General before me in this case, dissenting). \r\n\r\nThat commerce cannot be carried on without the agency of persons, and the tax, the effect of which is to diminish personal intercourse, is a tax on commerce. If the power to impose such a tax is acknowledged, it being a sovereign power, no limitation can be affixed to its exercise, and it may be so used as not only to diminish but destroy commerce. \r\n\r\nThe power asserted in the Act in question (the California Act) is the right of the State to prescribe the terms upon which the Chinese shall be permitted to reside in it, and be so used as to cut off all intercourse between them and the people of the State, and defeat the commercial policy of the nation. \r\n\r\nThat the Act could not be maintained as a police regulation; that a branch of the police power had been surrendered to the Federal Government as a part of the power to regulate commerce, and its exercise by a State was incompatible with the authority of the Government. \r\n\r\nThat the Chinese might be taxed as other residents, but could not be set apart as special objects of the taxation, and be compelled to contribute to the revenue of the State in the character of foreigners. \r\n\r\nThe reports of the higher California courts are of great authority for us on all Chinese questions, for there have been efforts for years past to restrict Chinese immigration in California, and the matter has been constantly before the superior courts there, and the judges there (if we may take the reports as correct) are more than ordinarily skilled in laying down the law correctly in constitutional points of that nature. Indeed, there is no other country which has such experience generally in constitutional law as applicable to a federation of states. \r\n\r\nOf course, in all the observations I make I recognize the now well-known distinction between the relations of a State of the Union to the Federal Government, and our relation as a Province to the Dominion. Still both Federal Governments have reserved to themselves the regulation of trade and commerce and naturalization and aliens; so the analogy is so close as to become almost a direct authority. \r\n\r\nIn the *Lin Sin* judgment, p. 579, the learned judge says of the power of taxing foreigners, as in the present *qua* foreigners: “If the power exist it may be exercised upon all foreigners residing in the State, and may be so exercised as to bar the door of foreign commerce as effectually as the Government could do by issuing its man-“date and closing its ports.\" \r\n\r\nAnd again \"to determine whether there is a conflict or not, i.e., of jurisdictions, the power must be considered with reference to its consequences, for its effect when carried out is the only criterion by which a judgment can be formed.\"\r\n\r\nIn another place he says:—\"It would be an empty sound to say that the several States cannot pass any law to prevent foreigners from coming here if they may pass laws which will compel such foreigners to depart as soon as they arrive.\" \r\n\r\nAnd again, \"A tax imposed by the law on these persons for the mere right to reside here, is an appropriate and effective means to discourage the immigration of the Chinese into the State.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the argument on the case before me, the Attorney-General claims that this was direct taxation, and a direct tax within the Province, to raise revenue for Provincial purposes, and, therefore *intra vires*; but the question is not one of name but of fact. Does it interfere with trade or commerce? Can it be legally imposed on foreigners as foreigners, for even a legal tax in other respects becomes illegal when it goes beyond its proper limits, and interferes with powers exclusively given to the Dominion for the benefit of all? \r\n\r\nIn another California case, *In re Tiburcio Parrott*, it is laid down that if the apparent object of a statute is under a pretense of the exercise of constitutional powers to drive Chinese away, the end sought to be obtained being unlawful, the statute is void. \r\n\r\nIn *Russell v. Reg.* it is decided that the true nature and character of legislation must be determined in order to ascertain its legality. \r\n\r\nIn *Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons*, we have to look at the legislation for the same purpose. \r\n\r\nIf the legislation here be to drive people from the country, have the local legislature the power? Legislation as to aliens is reserved to the Dominion. And as to trade and commerce, if the Chinese be driven out an annual loss to the revenue, it appears by the tables in the Chinese Commission Report, of $110,000 will take place; and more than $1,500,000 of property and business be lost to us, besides an injury to trade to an incalculable extent. The amount of business transacted by Chinamen in British Columbia, as revealed by the tables in that Chinese Report, is something which a casual observer would have no idea of. \r\n\r\nThe treaties between Great Britain and China, which bind us, have been quoted. The treaty of 25th August, 1842, *Hertslet*, Vol. 6, ratified 26th June, 1843, p. 221, and Lord Elgin's treaty of October, 1860, authenticated copies of which were produced in Court, secure to Chinese coming into British dominions the same \"full security for persons and property as subjects of Her Majesty.\" \r\n\r\n*Vattell*, cap. 8, referring to our obligations to foreigners, observes:— \"As soon as the lord of the territory admits strangers into it he engages \"to protect them as his own subjects, and to afford them perfect security as far as depends on him.\"\r\n\r\n*Reg. v. Severn* and *Reg. v. Russell* are important authorities in guiding our enquiry as to the nature and effect of local legislation in determining whether and how far the Act under review exceeds the limits within which the local legislature is supreme. And as to the equality of taxation, besides *Cooley*, who has been quoted freely on both sides, in *Kent's Commentaries* (8th Ed.), 2nd Vol., 388, it is insisted—\"That every person is entitled to be protected in the enjoyment of his property, not only from invasions of it by individuals, but from all unequal and undue assessments on the part of the Government. It is not sufficient that no tax or imposition can be imposed upon the citizens, but by their representatives in the legislature the citizens are entitled to require that the legislature itself shall cause all public taxation to be fair and equal in proportion to the value of 'property\" (and that is what *Cooley* means by apportionment of taxation), \"so that no class of individuals, and no species of property shall be unduly assessed.\" The treaties I have quoted between Great Britain and China, binding on the Dominion and on us in British Columbia, secure to the Chinese, just as the treaties between Great Britain and other foreign countries secure to other foreigners, the same rights in regard to the equality of taxation which I have described as being enjoyed by citizens of this country. \r\n\r\nThese treaties have the force of international law, and are continued most strongly against the party for whose benefit they are introduced. \r\n\r\nIn the case of the Chinese treaties, they were forced at the point of the bayonet on China, to obtain a right for us to enter China, and in return for a similar permission to us, full permission was given for the Chinese to trade and reside in British dominions everywhere. \r\n\r\nIn the treaties of 1858 and 1860, made at the solicitation of Great Britain, the Emperor of China was induced to give permission to his subjects to go and trade and reside \"in British Colonies,\" and to enter into \"engagements with British subjects for that purpose.\" \r\n\r\nThese obligations are binding here and in other parts of the Dominion under section 132 of the British North America Act, and no Province, or the Dominion itself, can lawfully pass laws interfering with that right without a previous revision of the treaties by the high contracting parties to them for that purpose. Treaties with foreign nations are above all ordinary municipal law, for obvious international reasons, for without such a provision there can be no permanent security, which is the life of all commercial intercourse. The same provisions that apply to Chinese may be made to apply also to Americans, Frenchmen, Germans, or any other foreigners. Such treaties are the especial care of the Dominion, and where local legislation clashes with that especial province of the Dominion, the legislation of the Province must give way, as laid down in Leprohon v. the City of Ottawa, 40 Q.B., Ont., 478; Reg. v. Chandler, Hannay's New Brunswick Reports, 548; Dow v. Black, L.R. 6 P.C. 272; L'Union St. Jacques v. Belisle, L.R. 6 P.C. 31, and numerous other Canadian authorities, besides the British North America Act itself. Now applying the principles and tests I have described to the Act before us, what do we find? The Act is found associated with another Act now disallowed, the express object of which is to prevent the Chinese altogether from coming to this country, and the principle \"noscitur a sociis\" is kept up by the preamble of the present Act, which describes the Chinese in terms which, I venture to think, have never before in any other country found a place in an Act of Parliament. \r\n\r\nIn the definition of the persons affected by the Act no distinction is made of ambassadors, merchants, consuls, artists, professors or travellers, or sex, whether under disability or not, or at such a distance from a collector as to make it difficult or impossible to obtain a license. Every person of Chinese origin, whether naturalized in Hong Kong or America, or any other State with which we are at amity, so long as they are of Chinese origin, 14 years of age—every one without distinction—must take out a license. For the purpose of argument I have treated the license fee as a tax; but it is in fact a license—a license to remain in British Columbia unmolested for a year. When the legislature wanted to create a tax, they knew what words to use for the purpose, for in the sister Act passed on the same day, which was disallowed, they called the impost there enacted a \"tax,\" not a license. However difficult or impossible for any Chinese to find a district collector, if such Chinese is \"found without a license he is liable to a fine of $40.\" At every turn he is confronted with an exceptional duty, and an exceptional penalty, and the loss of his goods and chattels, and of personal liberty. \r\n\r\nIt is impossible but that such an imposition so enforced, in addition to all the general taxes to which he is subject, should make this country too hot for him to live in; and just in proportion as he is so persecuted out of the country, in that degree does this enactment interfere with trade and commerce and that control over aliens exclusively given to the Dominion. And not only is he thus attacked, but unheard of provisions are introduced. Every employé of Chinese labour, whether English, American, or what not, is made liable to severe and incessant liability of a penal kind, for what? Some act, a default of his own? No; an act or default of a stranger, a man whose language he knows not, and for every infraction of the Act by the Chinese under his employ. The palpable object of such a provision, or set of provisions, is to render the employment of Chinese so distasteful and annoying to the employer that he must cease to employ them. Now, to pass a law providing that employment shall not be given to a special class of men, except it be productive of so much danger, annoyance, and loss to the employer, is just another way of saying that no intercourse shall be had with that class. With penalties and prosecutions always before you, far in excess of any advantage to be derived from that intercourse or trade, what is that but equivalent to saying that such intercourse or trade or labour must cease altogether. What is that but interfering with aliens, trade, and commerce? \r\n\r\nIf a man employ a Chinaman who should happen to be delinquent in his tax, and he happens to occupy a cottage or room of his employer, with his master's goods in it, under section 10 they are liable to seizure and sale. In every prosecution under the Act the legal presumption of innocence until conviction is reversed; in every case the onus probandi, though in a Statute highly penal, is shifted from the informant on to the shoulders of the accused, and he a foreigner not knowing one word of the law, or even the language of the accuser. In other words, every Chinese is guilty until proved innocent—a provision which fills one conversant with subjects with alarm; for if such a law can be tolerated as against Chinese, the precedent is set, and in time of any popular outcry can easily be acted on for putting any other foreigners or even special classes among ourselves, as coloured people, or French, Italians, Americans, or Germans, under equally the same law. That certainly is interfering with aliens. \r\n\r\nThe proposition that it is a Provincial tax for revenue purposes, supposing it to be so intended under the provisions of the Act, is so manifestly calculated to defeat that object, by diminishing the numbers of the members of the persons to be affected by it, that it is difficult to regard it in that light, or in any other light than an indirect mode of getting rid of persons whom it affects out of the country. The whole Act teems with special provisions which affect not only Chinese, but their employers, with obligations and liabilities as to the conduct of the Chinese in their employ, that no reasonable man would encounter, and run the risk of the penal consequences which the Act hangs over him. \r\n\r\nFor instance, by section 19 any pecuniary penalty imposed may be summarily recovered (and applies to employers), and in default of immediate payment the same may be recovered by distress of the goods and chattels of the offender, and in default of sufficient distress by a liability to imprisonment for three calendar months, and the employers would necessarily be white men. \r\n\r\nIn fact, the Act so bristles with these arbitrary, exceptional and penal consequences, that it is invidious to single out particular ones for comment. It is enough to add that \"any person,\" no matter whether white or Chinese, imprisoned in respect of any infraction of the provisions of the Act, may be at the will of the executive, subjected even to hard labour. \r\n\r\nThe Act is so full of provisions that interfere directly with aliens, with trade, and with commerce, that I have no hesitation in pronouncing all such provisions, and among them those under which the appellant in this case has been convicted, to be ultra vires the local legislature, and consequently illegal and void. \r\n\r\nSo far, I have dealt with the Act on its own merits; but if we consider it in juxtaposition to the Dominion Act recently passed restricting the Chinese throughout all Canada, its illegality becomes transparent; for in passing that Act against the Chinese the Dominion has spoken by the highest authority which it possesses—its own Parliament. By the Constitutional Act the subject of aliens, we have seen, is specially reserved to the Dominion, and it is now an axiom, in the interpretation of that Act, that when that authority deals with a subject expressly included in its jurisdiction by the 91st section, it has possession of that subject exclusively, and the Province has to give way. It is a great assumption of power on the part of a Province to pass laws, the effect of which must be practically to expel a particular class of aliens from that Province, to say in effect that it will by its legislation impede or prevent that class from being employed in another Province—say the North-west Territory or Manitoba—where railway works may be languishing for want of that very class of labourers, British Columbia being the only sea-board of Canada on the Pacific through which (in face of the restrictive laws of the United States) that class of labourers can enter and pass through; that is, in fact, legislating on all inter-provincial immigration; in other words, such legislation is ultra vires, and so I pronounce it; and adjudge accordingly, and quash the conviction, with costs. \r\n\r\n\r\n"

         "CREASE, J.\r\n\r\nWONG HOY WOON v. DUNCAN.\r\n\r\n1894. Oct. 22.\r\n\r\nHealth regulations—Victoria Health By-Law, 1893, Secs. 32, 35—\"Infected locality\"—Proof of—\"Exposed to infection.\"\r\n\r\nAction of trespass against the Medical Health Officer of the City of Victoria for causing the plaintiff, one of a number of Chinamen, who landed at Victoria in a steamer last from Hong Kong in China, to be removed to the \"Suspect Station\" and there detained and subjected to cleansing process under colour of Sec. 35 of the Municipal Health By-Law, 1893, giving him, as Medical Health Officer, power \"To stop, detain and examine every person or persons, freight, cargoes, railway and tramway cars coming from a place infected with a malignant or infectious disease,\" in order to prevent the introduction of such into Victoria.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff had been passed by the Dominion Government Quarantine Officer as entitled to land at Victoria.\r\n\r\nThe white passengers from Hong Kong on the same steamer were not interfered with. The only evidence of Hong Kong being a place infected, etc., was that of a medical man resident in Victoria, who said \"That in China small pox was endemic, because there inoculation was the universal practice. That there was danger of infection from white passengers, but not the same danger as from Chinamen.\" There was no direct evidence of the existence of small pox to a dangerous extent in Hong Kong at the time of the departure thence of the steamer, or that it was \"a place infected,\" etc., or that the plaintiff had been \"exposed to infection.\"\r\n\r\nHeld, That the facts were insufficient to justify the action of the Health Officer under the by-law.\r\n\r\nRemarks on the duties of Health Officers.\r\n\r\nStatement ACTION, claiming damages, for trespass. The facts fully appear from the head note and from the judgment.\r\n\r\nH. Dallas Helmcken, for the plaintiff.\r\n\r\nW. J. Taylor, for the defendant.\r\n\r\nJudgment. CREASE, J.: This was a test action to try whether Chinamen have the same rights as other foreigners in landing here on their advent from China.\r\n\r\nThe occasion was the arrival of the Empress of China at the Outer Wharf, which is within the city limits of Victoria, on the 1st day of May, 1894, from China and Hongkong.\r\n\r\nThe action is one nominally rather than really, for damages against Dr. George Duncan, the Health Officer of the City of Victoria, on account of an alleged excess of duty in despatching en masse, without examination or enquiry, a number of Chinamen out to the suspect station at Ross Bay, there to be disinfected and scrubbed. No white passenger from the same port (Hongkong, the last port touched at) having been treated in a similar manner or apparently even questioned or detained. The Chinamen had already been examined on board the ship by the Dominion Quarantine Officers and Provincial officers and passed. Hoy Woon had also paid the $50 required by the Government as his entry fee into British Columbia, and was in possession of the proper receipt.\r\n\r\nDr. Duncan then appears on the scene, and finds these men already passed and landed clear of ship, Dominion Judgment customs and entrance.\r\n\r\nDisregarding the white men, who had come at the same time from the same place and in the same ship and presumably subject to some of the same unsanitary influences, though not to the same extent as the Chinese, without any reason for special suspicion, without inspecting or attempting to inspect a single man, (that had already been done individually by the Dominion Quarantine Officers) he orders them into the custody of his constables to be taken out to the suspect station at Ross Bay, there to be washed and disinfected and scrubbed. They, with their goods and chattels, were bundled into a common truck like so many cattle.\r\n\r\nThe plaintiff and other Chinamen similarly situated obtained a writ of Habeas Corpus, upon which they were discharged from this custody.\r\n\r\nThereupon the present action was brought to test if and how far Chinamen are to be treated, when they land on our shores, differently from other foreigners.\r\n\r\nThe grounds alleged by the Health Officer for this arbitrary treatment is “that China is an infected locality,” and all persons coming from China and especially in this instance Hongkong, and especially also the natives of China, come from an infected locality, and that he has that authority under the Health By-Law, 1893, which was passed at the time of the small pox panic in Victoria, and, in all he did, was simply doing his duty.\r\n\r\nSection 32 of that by-law (published in the B.C. Gazette of April 20, 1893) directs a strict examination to be made of any vessel and persons coming from “an infected locality,” before any person, luggage or freight or other thing is allowed to be landed from it.\r\n\r\nSection 35 of the Health By-Law of 1893 gives the Medical Health Officer power to stop, detain and examine every person or persons, freight, cargoes, railway and tramway cars coming from a place “infected with a malignant Judgment. pestilential or infectious disease,” in order to prevent the introduction of the same into Victoria.\r\n\r\nThe case was tried before a jury upon the issue whether Hongkong, the last port the steamer left in China, was or not “an infected locality.” To prove that Hongkong was such, Dr. Davie was placed in the witness box as an expert. He considered “China the home of small pox,” and that it was “an infected place”; that, in China, small pox was “endemic,” i.e., always there; because there “inoculation” was the universal practice and was a constant source of danger; that in England and Europe and America, generally, vaccination, of late years, has been the rule. That was a preventative, and persons from such places were naturally not so much the object of suspicion or inspection to a health officer. He thought that too close a scrutiny could not be made of Chinese passengers. That small pox must have been in China on the 19th April last, the date when the Empress left Hongkong, as it was always there. He had no opinion to express as to the British possession of Hongkong; but it was a portion of China, where small pox was always, in a sense, \"endemic.\" There was danger of infection from white passengers, but not the same danger as from Chinamen. It was his opinion that every one should be examined who comes from China or from any \"infected port.\"\r\n\r\nThey should be examined on the ship. When asked the question, \"Would you allow Chinamen to land and go into the city?\" the Doctor replied, \"The whole of the baggage should be disinfected, on the steamer if possible—if not, on the Outer Wharf. If I could not do anything else I would take them out to the suspect station. I would, if I could,\" he continued, \"examine every passenger from there at the Outer Wharf. To do this it requires certain facilities which are wanting at the Outer Wharf.\" The duty of the Health Officer, as Dr. Davie understood it, was to interview the ship's officers and ascertain the sanitary state of the ship during the voyage; to inspect the whole of the men, inspect every individual, before he left the vessel. He was of Judgment opinion that the whole of those landed should be disinfected. The Chinese are chiefly dressed in woollen materials and these harbour infection for weeks and months. The period of incubation of small pox was from twelve to fifteen days. Cases of small pox were found in all large seaport towns, as for instance Liverpool; but these were not \"endemic.\"\r\n\r\nIf the vessel left Honkong, it was quite possible some cases might develop during the passage. If they were not examined on the steamer there were no facilities for doing so on the wharf. There were several other diseases to be guarded against from China, e.g., cholera, leprosy, etc. (Here I observe that from first to last no mention was made of the black plague, which has carried off so many thousands of Chinese in Hongkong; and it appeared that during the passage from China to Victoria, which presumably lasted over the ordinary period of inoculation, no case of small pox appeared on board the Empress, and that she showed a clean bill of health.)\r\n\r\n1894. Upon the question whether or not Hongkong, at the time the steamer left on April 19, 1894, was or not \"an infected port,\" in the sense of Sec. 35, a place \"infected by a malignant, pestilential or infectious disease,\" and they were so charged. The jury returned the following verdict:—\r\n\r\n\"According to the evidence we find that on 1st May, 1894, Hongkong was an infected port. We speak according to the evidence of Dr. Davie, that the port of Hongkong was and is an infected port.\" Now this assumes, as Dr. Davie assumed, that Hongkong, although a British port and subject to quarantine regulations, was (which includes the time of the steamer's departure) and is a cradle of small pox, and that every ship coming thence to Victoria, especially with Chinese on board, should be subject to the most searching examination, and the drastic treatment I have described. He does not include Japanese in the same category as Chinese. It was apparent throughout the Judgment. Doctor's evidence that he regarded the whole subject exclusively from a medical point of view, which is by no means identical with the legal construction which must prevail. The law, while it imposes on the Medical Health Officer the duty and arms him with abundant authority to deal imperatively almost in every case, at the same time insists that he shall discharge that duty with judgment and discretion, and not overrun the mark.\r\n\r\nIn this case, to say the least, he has not discharged his duty discreetly, but, on the contrary, has exceeded it. The whole gist of the by-law is to guard the case of persons \"infected or exposed to infection,\" words which have a definite legal meaning, which applies to persons who have been brought into actual contact with or within the baleful influence of an infectious or contagious disease, as travelling in the same carriage or boat with anyone affected by the disease, and not securely isolated from accidental or other contact, or has recently come from a locality where from an accumulation of cases or other reason the disease has got into the air and become epidemic.\r\n\r\nThis construction applies to Sections 12, 13, 15, 16 and 29 of the by-law by the wording of which this meaning is distinctly brought out.\r\n\r\nHis duty was, if he considered the Empress of China came from \"an infected locality,\" at once to go on board the suspected vessel and make his examination and inspection on board the vessel (as Section 32 says), \"before any luggage, freight or other thing is landed or allowed to be landed.\"\r\n\r\nIt goes further and shews that the only person to be \"dealt with in such manner as the Medical Health City Officer shall direct\" is \"any infected or exposed person from on board,\" under none of which categories do the plaintiff or other Chinamen, seized and carted off on this occasion, happen to come.\r\n\r\nThere was not an atom of actual proof before the jury of Judgment. the actual existence of a single case of small pox in Hong-kong in April or May or since, beyond a medical opinion that there might be.\r\n\r\nNow a medical opinion, however valuable as an opinion, is not the legal proof of a fact. It would be a painful surprise to the people of Hongkong and its business men, living under British rule, to learn that, on the strength only of the opinion of a learned expert, their place is given out to the world as an infected place, which the by-law interprets to mean a place \"infected with a malignant, pestilential or infectious disease,\" without any actual proof of the fact. In this case the plaintiff had been already duly and personally examined by Dr. McNaughton Jones, the able and experienced Health Officer, on his arrival, and passed. He had also been examined and passed by the Customs House officers as a man who had paid all his customs dues and had a certificate to shew the fact, which left him free to come and go as he pleased. It is not shewn that Dr.Duncan went on board, or that he conferred with the Dominion Health Officers as to whether any further examination of the plaintiff was necessary, or, in the public interest, advisable. It is shewn that he did not personally examine a single Chinaman or inquire if he was “an infected or exposed person.” In a matter affecting the public health, it is quite natural, and everyone would expect that officers who are armed with extensive sanitary powers, should confer together and assist one another in carrying out the law, and work well together for the public good and safety. Where that is not done the public are quick to note and comment on the fact.\r\n\r\nThe by-law is very properly arbitrary in its provisions and the powers it confers in cases of emergency, or even actual suspicion, on the Health Officer and his subordinates and these should be supported wherever practicable and the occasion warrants their employment.\r\n\r\nBut it should be understood that these exceptional powers are a great trust placed in the hands of the Health Officer to meet such cases as I have described, and at all times to be administered with firmness, judgment and discretion—not under any fear of infection unwarranted by the facts of the case which may enter into the mind of the Health Officer, or to be carried out by carting off en masse to the suspect station all who hail from China or Hongkong without examination or enquiry. The evidence shews there was nothing like emergency in the present case or anything to warrant the treatment they received.\r\n\r\nOn a review of the facts I am of opinion that the defendant exceeded his authority and caused the plaintiff great unnecessary loss and annoyance. I therefore give judgment for plaintiff against the defendant, but, as it is a test case, with only $5 damages and costs to be taxed.\r\n\r\nJudgment for plaintiff."

Act, Sec. 92, s.s. 9-Taration-Municipal license fees-Direct or indirect tax-Construction of statute-Words ejusdem generis.\r\n\r\nThe Municipal Act, 1885, Sec. 10, extended the powers of municipalities so as to include \" licensing and regulating wash-houses and laundries,\" and Sec. 11 enacts that Municipalities may \" hereafter levy and collect from every person who keeps or carries on a public washhouse or laundry, such sum as shall be fixed on by by-law, not exceeding $75.00 for every 6 months.\"\r\n\r\nOn appeal from a conviction for carrying on a public laundry without a license.\r\n\r\nHeld, (1) Taxation by means of license fees, and the tax in question, is indirect and not direct taxation.\r\n\r\n(2) All indirect taxation, except that authorized by Sec. 92, s.s. 9. B.N.A. Act, providing \"in each province the legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to (9) shop, tavern, saloon, auctioneer and other licenses in order to the raising of a revenue for provincial, local or municipal purposes \" is ultra vires of the Provincial Legislature.\r\n\r\n(3) The words \"and other licenses\" only included industries ejusdem generis with those specified, and do not include a wash-house.\r\n\r\n(4) The most reasonable rule to adopt to ascertain whether a certain matter or thing is within the meaning of a statute as being ejusdem generis with things specified therein \"and others,\" is to look to the object or mischief aimed at by the statute. All similar things that come within that object, though not in the abstract ejusdem generis are so for the purposes of the statute.\r\n\r\n(5) If it appears that a tax is not bona fide within the purpose provided for, but is imposed with the real purpose of discriminating against a class, it is not within the justification of the enabling statute, and, on the facts, the tax in question was intended not for the purpose of raising a revenue, but as a restriction on the Chinese.\r\n\r\nAPPEAL from a conviction for carrying on a public laundry without a license and payment of the license fee under a by-law of the Corporation of the City of Victoria based on Sec. 11 of Municipal Amendment Act, 1885.\r\n\r\nThe facts and arguments of counsel fully appear from the judgment.\r\n\r\nA. N. Richards, Q.C., for the appeal.\r\n\r\nJ. S. Yates, contra.\r\n\r\nBEGBIE, C.J .: This is an appeal from a conviction for carrying on a public laundry without a license and payment of the license fee under a recent by-law. It was not denied by the appellant that the by-law is authorized by the recent Provincial Act, the only question is whether that Provincial Act, viz .: clause 11 of the Municipal Amendment Act, 1885, is constitutional within the meaning of the British North America Act. Section 10 of the Provincial Act extends the powers of the Corporation so as expressly to include \"licensing and regulating wash-houses and laundries,\" and Section 11, referring to the existing expressed powers of Corporations to issue other licenses and collect fees or taxes in respect thereof, expressly adds this, that they may hereafter levy and collect \" from every person who keeps or carries on a public wash-house or laundry such sum as shall be fixed by by-law not exceeding $75.00 for every 6 months.\" This is the clause impugned.\r\n\r\nThe clause in the B.N.A. Act upon which alone this Section of the Provincial Act is based is Section 92. \" In each province the Legislature may exclusively make laws in relation to * * * (sub-section 9) shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer and other licenses in order to the raising of a revenue for Provincial, local or Municipal purposes. Sub-section 16. \"Generally all matters of a merely local or private nature in the Province \" does not, I think, apply to taxation.\r\n\r\nThe only other sub-section which confers on the Provincial Legislature any power to tax is sub-section 2 which deals with direct taxation within the Province in order \" to the raising of a revenue for Provincial purposes.\" But neither can this sub-section have any application here. 1st. It deals only with direct taxes and this taxation by means of license fee is indirect, not direct taxation. Severn's case, 2 S.C. Can. R. pp. 70, 90, 92, 113, 123, 137. 2nd. It deals only with taxation within, i.e. generally, throughout the ProvBEGBIE, C.J. ince, and these laundry license fees are only to be levied COUNTY COURT within Municipalities, and may vary in different parts of 1886. Feb. 3. the Province. 3rd. It only authorizes taxes for Provincial revenue and these license fees are to fall into the MuniciREGINA 0. MEE WAH pal revenue. The consideration of sub-section 2, therefore, merely emphasizes the proposition (according to the Attorney-General of Quebec v. The Queen Assurance Company, 3 L.R. App. Cas. 1090) that all indirect taxation for Municipal purposes except what is authorized by sub-section 9 is illegal.\r\n\r\nThe first objection taken by Mr. Richards (viz.) that the clause is unconstitutional merely and broadly because it imposes an indirect tax seems to be too general. Such taxation will be valid enough, if the enactment comes fairly within the meaning of sub-section 9, nor can the next objection be fatal (viz.) the objection merely and broadly that it is in restraint of trade. Whether washing be a trade or a mere industry will presently be considered. UnquesJudgment. tionably all taxation on buying and selling, all interference with labour, may and perhaps must to some extent restrain trade, yet some instances of taxation of trades, and some regulations of labour, are undoubtedly within the power of the Provincial Legislature. Besides, this enactment, and . consequent by-law, do not absolutely restrain, i.e. forbid this industry. The laundryman may remove beyond the city limits and quite evade the tax.\r\n\r\nSetting aside therefore these broad objections to the tax, as too general, the questions are two, (viz.)\r\n\r\n1st. Does this license come within the words \"shop, saloon, tavern, auctioneer and other license?\" and,\r\n\r\n2nd. Is the tax imposed in order to raise a Municipal revenue, or is it imposed for any other purpose ? e.g. for restriction or suppression, total or partial.\r\n\r\nThe answer to the first question depends on the force of the words \"other licenses.\" Whether that means other licenses on matters of the same kind as the four enumerated, according to the general rule of construction, or whether it means licenses for the doing or permitting any other thing whatever. It is said by a learned text writer, Sir P. Maxwell on Statutes, p. 303, that the rule restraining the generality of the word \" other \" to matters ejusdem generis only applies where the things actually named are themselves all of the same nature; but that where the things named are of different natures then the phrase \" other things or articles\" will extend to all objects, though quite different from those named. Citing for this among other cases Regina v. Payne 1 C.C.R. 27. There a statute made it penal to convey to a prisoner, in order to facilitate his escape, \" any mask, disguise, letter or other article or thing;\" and it was held that a crowbar was within the Act. So in Young v. Grattridge, 4 L.R.Q.B. 166, a Health Act empowered a medical officer to enter and inspect \" any slaughter-house, shop, building, market or other place \" and it was held that a butcher's yard which contained slaughtered cattle was within the Statute, Regina v. Edmundson, 2 E. & E. 77, is to a similar effect. But these decisions do not for their support apparently require the principle enunciated by Maxwell, nor was any such principle alluded to in any of them. And though his statement deserves great respect being cited approvingly by a very learned Judge in Severn's case, yet it was not followed by the other four Judges, nor does it appear to be founded on any other judicial dictum. And indeed it is submitted that such a construction of the doctrine of ejusdem generis is in some sense self-destructive.\r\n\r\nIf the two or more things actually named are identical as \" air, atmosphere, or other gas;\" \" dagger, poniard or other weapon,\" then the word \" other \" is to be confined to other gases strictly of the same nature, it does not extend the phrase at all and if the two things named are not identical as \" oil, vinegar or other fluids,\" the word \" other \" would extend to all other fluids whatever. The doctrine of ejusdem generis which has occupied many Courts and many BEGBIE, C.J. judgments and which therefore does really exist, would run COUNTY COURT the risk of being annihilated. A more reasonable rule 1886. Feb. 3. REGINA MEE WAH would seem to be to look at the object or the mischief aimed at by the Statute or other instrument; all matters that come within that are ejusdem generis so far as the Statute is concerned. Thus in Gayne's case, a crow bar and a letter and a mask are no doubt extremely different in texture, weight and appearance. No painter or chemist would call them ejusdem generis; but they are all strictly ejusdem generis so far as that they are instruments calculated to facilitate a prisoner's escape. So in Young's case, a butcher's yard is strictly ejusdem generis with his shop and his slaughter house so far as regards the mischief of preparing unwholesome food. But a watchmaker's or a tailor's shop would not be ejusdem generis with a butcher's shop, though all are called shops; and meat in a tailor's shop would probably not have been liable to be seized under Statute in that instance.\r\n\r\nIf there were no matters or occupations having any analogy or attribute (except taxability) common to these four named instances in sub-section 9, the inference would be very strong that \" other licenses \" extended to every possible matter. But as was pointed out by Mr. Justice WILSON in Regina v. Taylor, 36 U.C.Q.B. 183, cited and approved in Severn v. Reginam, there are many analogous matters.\r\n\r\nRestaurants and lodging houses bear no distant resemblance to taverns; coffee shops to saloons (though these again are utterly distinct from a teetotaler's point of view) and there are coupled together in the Insolvency Act, Canada, 1875, Sec. 1, brokers and commission agents to auctioneers, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are two classes of Statutes in which words are always strictly construed in favour of the party charged, even at the suit of the Crown; Statutes which create offences and Statutes which impose taxation.\r\n\r\nThe present Municipal Amendment Act, 1885, partakes of both natures, and the ordinary rule must I think be observed, viz., the subjects of the \"other licenses \" mentioned in sub-section 9 must have at least somewhat besides taxability (from which quality no Act or thing is exempt) in common with \"shops, taverns, saloons or auctioneers.\"\r\n\r\nAgain suppose some other licenses, well known elsewhere, taxes as in England on man-servants, on hair powder, on armourial bearings-would these be authorized by subsection 9? I think not. Indeed if no restriction whatever be placed on the word \" other\" in that section; if the Provincial Legislature can insist upon imposing licenses upon everything and upon every act of life, and tax each licensee at any moment they please, there would be a very simple way of excluding every Chinaman from the Province, by imposing a universal tax, not limited to any nationality, of one or two thousand dollars per annum for a license to Judgment. wear long hair on the back of the head: or to exclude Russians by a license to wear a beard, or Jews by a license to eat unleavened bread. No Chinaman will shave the back of his head; no true moujik will shave his chin. There might be a tax on a license to register lands above a certain value; and we might have a graduated property tax. The opinion, therefore, of the majority of the Judges in Severn's case, seems more probable. There must I think be some limitation placed on the licensing power by the word \" other.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Yates argued from even that point of view these laundries were taxable, for that the laundry men though they were very certainly not keeping shops, were very analogus to auctioneers. I rather think that the auctioneers would repudiate this alleged similarity of their occupation to that of a Chinese washerman. I cannot perceive it. An auctioneer has very extensive authority and important duties; he prepares advertisements and surveys, disposes property in lots, advises as to prices, and generally is the agent of both parties to the contract of sale. There is nothing of all BEGBIE. C.J. this in a laundry; and I feel strongly inclined to think that COUNTY COURT laundries are not taxable under this sub-section at all, bearing no analogy to either \"shops, saloons, taverns or auctioneers.\"\r\n\r\nBut without deciding on this ground there is a still more serious obstacle against supporting this clause 11 of the Provincial Act of 1885, as being within Section 92, subseetion 9. The taxation by way of license authorized by that sub-section 9 is to be \"in order to the raising a revenue for Provincial, local or Municipal purposes.\" Now, licences may have for their object the raising of a revenue, or the regulation of a trade or occupation, or they may be imposed for the purpose of repression or suppression. And whatever power the Provincial Legislature may possess for regulation or repression; taxation for these two latter purposes is not authorized by the B.N.A. Act, but only taxation for the purpose of revenue. And it is roundly alleged by the appellant that this tax is imposed, not with the object of raising a revenue for the City, but with the object of harJudgment. assing Chinamen, supposed to be the only persons carrying on this industry.\r\n\r\nIn considering this objection, we must distinguish between the real objects and the actual results of legislation. It is true the real object is very often, perhaps in most cases, shown by the result. But an Act which has bona fide only one object, may indirectly work out an entirely collateral result. An Act intended purely for a revenue, or regulation may greatly harass some particular individuals or classes of individuals; e.g. the Excise Acts. But the harassing of brewers is not the object of the Excise Acts. So on the other hand an Act intended purely for harassing of some one or more individuals may incidentally bring money into the City treasury. That incidental result will not validate the Statute, if the real object be unlawful. The objection to apply at all, must depend on the object, declared or dissembled, and not merely on the result or one COUNTY COURT of the results of the provisions of the Act.\r\n\r\n1886. If the object of the Provincial Statute be as alleged, viz., Feb. 3. REGINA v. MEE WAH to subject Chinamen to exceptional disadvantages it is clearly unconstitutional. That point has been so held in this Court by Mr. Justice GRAY in Tai Lung's case, reported appx. G. to the report of the recent Chinese Conmission, p. 379, and by Mr. Justice CREASE in Wing Chong's case, 1 B.C.R. Pt. II, 150, both these learned Judges fortifying their opinions by numerous decisions and arguments of Judges in the United States' Courts. Those decisions are not binding on us here; and indeed are partly founded on the Constitution of the United States and its relation to the several States, which in many respects differ from the Constitution and the relation between the Dominion and the Provinces. But the Judges in those foreign Courts have had a much longer and more varied experience on these topics than ourselves; their institutions are closely analogous in many Judgment. respects, though, it is true, contrasted in others to our own. And their opinions and reasonings being also founded on international law, and, I take the liberty of saying, on natural equity and common sense, they are entitled to great weight beyond the limits of their own jurisdiction. I shall only mention Lee Sing v. Washburn, 20 Cal. Rep. 354; Baker v. Portland, 5 Law 750; Teburcio Parrott's case, coram SAWYER and HOFFMAN, J.J., 1880, and the Quene ordinance case, coram FIELD and SAWYER, J.J., 1879; the two latter cases published in a separate pamphlet form, in which the opinions of Mr. Justices FIELD, HOFFMAN, SAWYER and DEADY and other Judges whom they cite, all confirm this, that a State, or Provincial law imposing special disabilities or unequal burdens on Chinamen is unconstitutional and void. In British Columbia such a law if it impose a tax labours under the additional infirmity that a licence tax for any other purpose with any other object, than merely raising a revenue, is beyond the power of the Provincial Legislature to impose.\r\n\r\nMr. Yates, for the Corporation, urged that this Statute is COUNTY COURT very different from the Statutes condemned by Mr. Justice 1886. Feb. 3. CREASE in Wing Chong's case and by Mr. GRAY in Tai Lung's case; those. Statutes were by their title and preamble REGINA v. MEE WAH expressly aimed at Chinamen by name; that this distinction also renders inapplicable all the United States' cases cited; that this enactment is quite general extending to all laundries without exception and we must not look beyond the words of the enactment to enquire what its object was; that there is in fact one laundry in Victoria not conducted by Chinamen on which the tax will fall with equal force so that it is impossible to say that Chinamen are hereby exclusively selected for taxation; the circumstance that they are chiefly affected being a mere coincidence; that the bylaw only imposes $100.00 per annum, keeping far within the limit of $150.00 permitted by the Statute; that the tax clearly is calculated to procuring additional Municipal revenue and that no other object is hinted at.\r\n\r\nNow it is true that this Statute does not, like those dealt with by Mr. Justice GRAY and Mr. Justice. CREASE by its Judgment. very title bind illegality upon its forehead; nor is there here any preamble like that in Wing Chong's case which Mr. Justice CREASE treats as \" without example,\" but which may well deserve the stern reproof uttered by Mr. Justice FIELD upon a somewhat similar enactment in California. \" It is not creditable to the humanity and civilization of our people, much less to their Christianity, that an ordinance of this character was possible.\" Quene ordinance case, p. 9.\r\n\r\nThe recent statute has nothing of that sort. But it is very justly insisted upon by every Judge that the object of a statute is after all to be determined by the effect of its operative part. The title and preamble may be very objectionable, but if the operative sections are within the power of the Legislature they shall stand. On the other hand, the preamble may breathe the spirit of the purest and most COUNTY COURT universal philanthropy, and the most submissive legality ;\r\n\r\n1886. but that will not save any clauses which are otherwise Feb. 3. unconstitutional. And in determining the quality of any REGINA v. MEE WAH clauses, the same Mr. Justice FIELD remarks : \" When we take our seats on the Bench, we are not struck with blindness and forbidden to know as Judges what we see as men ; and when an ordinance, though general in its terms, only operates upon a special race, sect or class, it being universally understood that it is to be enforced only against that race, sect or class, we may justly conclude that it was the intention of the body adopting it that it should only have such operation, and treat it accordingly.\" Now can anybody in the Province, on or off the Bench, conscientiously say that this ordinance does not come within the principle thus enunciated ? I, for my part, cannot arrive at any other conclusion than that it is specially directed against Chinamen because they are Chinamen and for no other Judgment. reason ; to compel them to remove certain industries from the city or themselves from the Province. But the authorities already cited show that this effect cannot be attained directly, and what cannot be done directly will not be permitted to be done by a side wind. Tiburcio Parrott's Case, pp. 1634; Cummings v. Missouri, 4 Wall 325. \" If we hold otherwise,\" said the learned Judge, in that case \"no kind of oppression can be named against which the framers of (the B.N.A. Act) intended to guard which may not be effected.\"\r\n\r\nThe appellants' contention that the clause is merely intended to hamper or expel Chinamen is much strengthened by considering the amount of the tax sanctioned, which is $150.00 per annum, whereas the limit sanctioned by the Legislature in the case of any retail shop, however extensive or lucrative its business, is only $10.00 per annum. In other words, this menial and poorly paid occupation may be taxed fifteen times the annual amount which the statute permits to be imposed on the most extensive grocery or dry goods store. It is impossible for me to believe that the BEGBIE, C.J, sole object or the main object of such an imposition is to aid the revenue of the Corporation.\r\n\r\nThe test is whether on the whole statute the Legislature can fairly be held to have said : \"Let us impose a tax in order to raise a revenue, though perhaps it may fall on Chinamen,\" or \" let us impose this tax in order to fall on Chinamen, though perhaps it will raise no revenue.\" When we find (1st) no other description of labour taxed at all ; (2nd) this description of labour practically quite abandoned to Chinamen alone ; (3rd) this description of labour taxed at fifteen times the rate permitted to be levied on any retail shop ; (4th) that a preliminary Provincial Act has declared Chinamen incapable of the franchise which they formerly exercised. I cannot doubt but that the tax is directed against Chinamen, as such.\r\n\r\nBut the enormously disproportioned rate of taxation has another consequence. It shows that revenue was not the sole object of the tax ; probably not the object at all. If the promoters of this clause had been really casting about for Judgment. additional revenue, they must have seen that shops are a great deal more numerous than laundries and generally more remunerative.\r\n\r\nIt requires very little financial ability to perceive that a a small addition of $5.00 or $10.00 on shops would enrich the city far more than $150.00 per annum on every laundry, even if this last amount could be collected. But here the magnitude of the tax would entirely defeat the professed object and support the view that the concealed object was the true one. The occupation of a washerman is very poorly paid ; probably at a lower rate than any other trade or occupation, since in former years men of all nationalities busied themselves with this, which they have wholly abandoned, presumably for more lucrative employment ; whereas the number of shops, &c., has very much increased. It must have been apparent on the commonest reflection that this, the most poorly paid occupation, cannot endure fifteen times the tax imposed on the most lucrative; that such a 1886. tax would probably extinguish every laundry in Victoria ; Feb. 3. and so that no additional revenue would be produced at all. REGINA v. MEE WAH I cannot imagine that any person reading the clause would be blind to this; and I am compelled to think that restriction and not revenue was the very object of the tax. But it is clear that the Provincial Legistature has under the B.N.A. Act no power to impose or authorize a tax for the purpose of driving any industry out of the city or the Province.\r\n\r\nClanse 11 in the Act of 1883 seems, therefore, quite ultra vires and unconstitutional; and the by-law, which I have taken to be admitted as otherwise accurate, stands upon that clause alone and must fall with it. In fact, if the bylaw only imposes a moderate and reasonable amount, say $5.00 or $10.00 per annum, it would probably be equally a nullity. Even a reasonable and useful by-law cannot stand Judgment. if authorized only by an unconstitutional statute.\r\n\r\nThe general conclusions arrived at are these: (1.) It seems probable that laundries are not taxable within Subsection 9 of Section 92 B.N.A. Act. (2.) Any clause in a Provincial Statute or Municipal By-Law, which, though general in its terms, operates, or is intended to operate only upon one sect, race or class, is liable to be declared unconstitutional and void. (3.) The object of a statute is to be ascertained not only from its title or preamble, but mainly from its enactments. (4.) That a by-law, even if founded upon a valid statute must be reasonable, i.e., not necessarily equal but proportionate, and not such as to defeat the object of the law. This is all in conformity with the previous decisions of Mr. Justice CREASE in Wing Chong's Case and Mr. Justice GRAY in Tai Lung's Case, which are approved and followed.\r\n\r\nIn this case I am moreover of opinion (5th) that the Provincial Legislature has no power to impose or authorize any\r\n\r\nlicense tax except for the bona fide object of raising revenue by the produce of the tax ; and that this Clause 11 was not enacted bona fide for that sole purpose or even mainly for 1886. that purpose, and is therefore unconstitutional and void. \r\n\r\nThe conviction will, therefore, be set aside with costs. Appeal allowed. "

B. BEGBIE, C. J. :-\r\n\r\nThis is an application for a mandamus to the Corporation of the City of Victoria, ordering them to issue a renewal of a pawnbroker's license to the prosecutors. The reason alleged by the Corporation for their refusal is that they have passed a resolution stating that in their opinion the prosecutors are not fit persons to be the recipients of such a license. It is alleged by the prosecution, and not denied, that the Council have in fact ordered the Collector to issue no pawnbroking license to any Chinaman. And the proposition was broadly advanced before me that the Provincial Legislature have the right to eliminate nationalities or individuals from the capacity to receive these trade licenses : and that they have, in conformity with Regina v. Hodge, delegated to the Council authority to exercise that right. The first of these contentions has already been before this Court, and has, I think, been entirely denied by several Judges now on the bench. In the first place by Mr. Justice Gray, in Tai Sing v. Macguire (1 B.C.R. pt. i. 101, 1878): by Mr. Justice Crease in Wing Fong's case (1 B.C.R. pt. ii. 150, 1885); and by myself in Mee Wall's case (not reported). These decisions have never been appealed, and I do not feel at liberty to disregard them. I must, therefore, assume that no such authority exists in the Provincial Legislature, and therefore it is impossible that they could have dele- gated it, or conferred it on the Council. Evidently, if such a power existed, then, since no man may in any municipality pursue any avocation without such license, the Local Legislature might exclude large classes of men from gaining a livelihood, or indeed existing in the Province-a very wide interference with \"trade and commerce,\" which is totally removed from their control by the B. N. A. Act.\r\n\r\nIt may be useful, however, to examine briefly the grounds on which the Council have been advised that they have a discretion in the matter. This was, in the argument before me, entirely based on the permissive form adopted in the Statute (\"Municipal Act, 1887,\" c. 16, s. 104). \" The municipality shall have power to issue licenses \" for the trades and professions enumerated, including pawnbrokers (sub-s. 10), \"and to levy and collect by means of such licenses the amounts\" therein specified. And stress was laid on the word \" license,\" as inti- mating a permission ; without which antecedent license or permission the proposing trader could not lawfully commence business (ss. 112, 113). But these words do not imply any discretion, i. e., authority to grant or refuse. Prima facie, every person living under the protec- tion of British law has a right at once to exercise his industry and ability in any trade or calling he may select. The only instances in which some antecedent certificate of fitness or qualification is required are, I think, liquor dealers, medical men, and barristers and solicitors. These also have to take out annual licenses under the Municipality Act. But special tribunals are appointed to judge antecedently of their fitness. And, I think, it is quite unheard of that the Council should arbitrarily assume to refuse a license to any of these classes, or to volunteer any statement of their opinion of the fitness or unfitness of a doctor or solicitor. If the Council is to have an absolute dis- cretion to refuse a license to any person applying, on the ground of what they choose to allege as unfitness, then half a dozen tradesmen may secure themselves an entire monopoly of their respective trades throughout the municipality, by simply voting that in their opinion each proposing competitor is an unfit person.\r\n\r\nBut if the least attention be bestowed on the Statute, it will be seen that the Legislature has given no discretion to the Council. The Statute does not even say they may \"grant \" licenses ; but only that they may issue them. The industrial classes are told, \" You may not carry on your trade in the municipality without a license; if you ask where to get a license, we have authorized the municipality to issue it on payment to them of the annual amount fixed by by-law.\" Now, enabling words are always compulsory when they are words to effectuate a legal right (Julius v. Bp. Oxford, 5 App. Ca., L. R. 214). And it is of course unnecessary to prove-I should, but for this class of cases, have supposed that it was unnecessary even to state-the undoubted right, which is the boast of English law, that every person living under it has a right to his industry, and to the fruits of it. And when we look to the form of the license in the schedule to the Act we see that it is not issued by the corporation at all (which could only be done under seal), and that it amounts to nothing more than the collector's receipt for the license money, and a certificate that so far as that is concerned (and that is all that concerns the corporation) the holder may exercise the calling therein specified.\r\n\r\nIt was alleged that the occupation of a pawnbroker affords peculiar facilities for the concealment of stolen goods and the escape of crim- inals, and that it is particularly essential that care should be exercised\r\n\r\nin the selection of persons to carry it on. It is, however, for the Legislature to speak on such a subject, and it has spoken. There are special laws relating to pawnbrokers. The business, it is true, is not, to most persons, attractive. A pawnbroker deals always with the needy, occasionally with the criminal classes: he must generally be hard, and always usurious. But he has always been considered a necessary evil. There has never, so far as I know, been placed any limit on their number, any more than on the number of bakers or butchers. It has been deemed sufficient to make special laws in respect to them and their books, and the supervision of the police. But so, also, are there many special laws for the inspection of butchers' shops under the Health Acts, and of grocers, and bakers, and milk dealers, and in fact of all traders, under the Weights and Measures Acts and the Adulteration Acts; and a reference to the London Police Courts will show that many classes of tradesmen far surpass the pawnbrokers in the number and importance of the charges against them before the stipendiary magistrates. In fact, the pawnbroker assists the detection of criminals perhaps as often as he defeats it, and is a most useful ally of the police.\r\n\r\nIt is not uninteresting to note the uniformity with which the same events result from the same principles, although in very different parts of the world. Victoria does not possess a monopoly of race jealousy. In the French colony of Cayenne, the Town Council recently handi- capped the superior capacities of the Chinaman by imposing on merchants of that empire an extra tax of $300 per annum, deeming it also expedient to handicap English and German traders by a surtax of $200 on them. But on an appeal to the Courts at Paris, all these impositions were declared null on the very same principles as those on which the Courts here insisted when they decided the cases above referred to, viz., as being infringements at once of personal liberty, and of the equality of all men before the law, and also negation of international rights.\r\n\r\nThe prosecutors are entitled to their writ, and as the law on the subject has been quite clearly laid down ten years ago by Mr. Justice Gray, and again and again by other Judges, the defendants must pay all costs.\r\n\r\nMandamus allowed."

         "QUONG WING v. THE KING. CAN.  \r\n\r\nSupreme Court of Canada, Sir Charles Fitzpatrick, C.J., Davies, Idington, Duff, and Anglin, JJ. February 23, 1914. 1914  \r\n\r\nFITZPATRICK, C.J:The appellant, a Chinaman and a naturalized Canadian citizen, was convicted of employing white female servants contrary to the provisions of chapter 17 of the statutes of Saskatchewan, 1912, and, for his defence, he contends that the Act in question is ultra vires of the provincial legislature.  \r\n\r\nIt is urged that the aim of the Act is to deprive the defendant and the Chinese generally, whether naturalized or not, of the rights ordinarily enjoyed by the other inhabitants of the Province of Saskatchewan and that the subject-matter of the Act is within the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada.  \r\n\r\nThe Act in question reads as follows: \r\n\r\n1. No person shall employ in any capacity any white woman or girl or permit any white woman or girl to reside or lodge in or to work in or, save as a bona fide customer in a public apartment thereof only, to frequent any restaurant, laundry or other place of business or amusement owned, kept or managed by any Chinaman.  \r\n\r\n2. Any employer guilty of any contravention or violation of this Act, shall, upon summary conviction be liable to a penalty not exceeding $100 and, in default of payment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two months.  \r\n\r\nIn terms the section purports merely to regulate places of business and resorts owned and managed by Chinese, independent of nationality, in the interest of the morals of women and girls in Saskatchewan. There are many factory Acts passed by provincial legislatures to fix the age of employment and to provide for proper accommodation for workmen and the conveni. ence of the sexes which are intended not only to safeguard the bodily health, but also the morals of Canadian workers, and I fail to understand the difference in principle between that legislation and this.  \r\n\r\nIt is also undoubted that the legislatures authorize the making by municipalities of disciplinary and police regulations to prevent disorders on Sundays and at night, and in that connection to compel tavern and saloon keepers to close their drinking places at certain hours. Why should those legislatures not have power to enact that women and girls should not be employed in certain industries or in certain places or by a certain class of people? This legislation may affect the civil rights of Chinamen, but it is primarily directed to the protection of children and girls.  \r\n\r\nThe Chinaman is not deprived of the right to employ others, but the classes from which he may select his employees are limited. In certain factories women or children under a certain age are not permitted to work at all, and, in others, they may not be employed except subject to certain restrictions in the interest of the employee's bodily and moral welfare. The difference between the restrictions imposed on all Canadians by such legislation and those resulting from the Act in question is one of degree, not of kind.  \r\n\r\nI would dismiss the appeal with costs.  \r\n\r\nDAVIES, J. : The question on this appeal is not one as to the policy or justice of the Act in question, but solely as to the power of the provincial legislature to pass it. There is no doubt that, as enacted, it seriously affects the civil rights of the Chinamen in Saskatchewan, 'whether they are aliens or naturalized British subjects. If the language of Lord Watson, in delivering the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in Union Colliery Company of British Columbia v. Bryden, [1899] A. C. 580, was to be accepted as the correct interpretation of the law defining the powers of the Dominion Parliament to legislate on the subject-matter of \"naturalization and aliens\" assigned to it by item 25 of section 91 of the British North America Act, 1867, I would feel some difficulty in upholding the legislation now under review. Lord Watson there said, at page 586 : \r\n\r\nBut sec. 91, sub-sec. 25, might, possibly, be construed as conferring that power in case of naturalized aliens after naturalization. The subject of \"naturalization\" seems, prima facie, to include the power of enacting what shall be the consequences of naturalization, or, in other words, what shall be the rights and privileges pertaining to residents in Canada after they have been naturalized. It does not appear to their Lordships to be necessary, in the present case, to consider the precise meaning which the term \"naturalization\" was intended to bear, as it occurs in sec. 91, sub-sec. 25. But it seems clear that the expression \"aliens,\" occurring in that clause, refers to and, at least, includes all aliens who have not yet been naturalized; and the words \"no Chinaman,\" as they are used in section 4 of the provincial Act, were, probably, meant to denote, and they certainly include every adult Chinaman who has not been naturalized.\r\n\r\nAnd, at page 587: But the leading feature of the enactments consists in this-that they have, and can have no application except to Chinamen who are aliens or naturalized subjects, and that they establish no rule or regulation except that these aliens or naturalized subjects shall not work, or be allowed to work, in underground coal mines within the Province of British Columbia.\r\n\r\nTheir Lordships see no reason to doubt that, by virtue of sec. 91, sub-sec. 25, the legislature of the Dominion is invested with exclusive authority in all matters which directly concern the rights, privileges and disabilities of the class of Chinamen who are resident in the provinces of Canada. They are also of opinion that the whole pith and substance of the enactments of section 4 of the Coal Mines Regulation Act, in so far as objected to by the appellant company, consists in establishing a statutory prohibition which affects aliens or naturalized subjects, and, therefore, trench upon the exclusive authority of the Parliament of Canada.\r\n\r\nIf the \"exclusive authority on all matters which directly concern the rights, privileges and disabilities of the class of Chinamen who are resident in the provinces of Canada\" is vested in the Dominion Parliament by sub-sec. 25 of sec. 91 of the B.N.A. Act, 1867, it would, to my mind, afford a strong argument that the legislation now in question should be held ultra vires.\r\n\r\nBut in the later case of Cunningham v. Tomey Homma, [1913] A.C. 151, the Judicial Committee modified the views of the construction of sub-sec. 25 of sec. 91 stated in the Union Colliery decision. Their Lordships say, at pages 156-157: Could it be suggested that the Province of British Columbia could not exclude an alien from the franchise in that province? Yet, if the mere mention of alienage in the enactment could make the law ultra vires, such a construction of sec. 91, sub-sec. 25, would involve that absurdity. The truth is that the language of that section does not purport to deal with the consequences of either alienage or naturalization. It, undoubtedly, reserves these subjects for the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion-that is to say, it is for the Dominion to determine what shall constitute either the one or the other, but the question as to what consequences shall follow from either is not touched. The right of protection and the obligations of allegiance are necessarily involved in the nationality conferred by naturalization; but the privileges attached to it, where these depend upon residence, are quite independent of nationality.\r\n\r\nReading the Union Colliery case, [1899] A.C. 580, therefore, as explained in this later case, and accepting their Lordships' interpretation of sub-sec. 25 of sec. 91, that \"its language does not purport to deal with the consequences of either alienage or naturalization,\" and that, while it exclusively reserves these subjects to the jurisdiction of the Dominion in so far as to determine what shall constitute either alienage or naturalization, it does not touch the question of what consequences shall follow from either, I am relieved from the difficulty I would otherwise feel.\r\n\r\nThe legislation under review does not, in this view, trespass upon the exclusive power of the Dominion legislature. It does deal with the subject-matter of \"property and civil rights\" within the province, exclusively assigned to the provincial legislatures, and so dealing cannot be held ultra vires, however harshly it may bear upon Chinamen, naturalized or not, residing in the province. There is no inherent right in any class of the community to employ women and children which the legislature may not modify or take away altogether. There is nothing in the British North America Act which says that such legislation may not be class legislation. Once it is decided that the subject-matter of the employment of white women is within the exclusive powers of the provincial legislature and does not infringe upon any of the enumerated subject-matters assigned to the Dominion, then such provincial powers are plenary.\r\n\r\nWhat objects or motives may have controlled or induced the passage of the legislation in question I do not know. Once I find its subject-matter is not within the powers of the Dominion Parliament and is within that of the provincial legislature, I cannot inquire into its policy or justice or into the motives which prompted its passage. But, in the present case, I have no reason to conclude that the legislation is not such as may be defended upon the highest grounds. The regulations impeached in the Union Colliery case, DOMINION LAW REPORTS. [18 D.L.R. [1899] A.C. 580, were, as stated by the Judicial Committee, in the later case of Tomey Homma, [1903] A.C. 151, at p. 157 not really aimed at the regulation of coal mines at all, but were in truth devised to deprive the Chinese, naturalized or not, of the ordinary rights of the inhabitants of British Columbia and, in effect, to prohibit their continued residence in that province, since it prohibited their earning their living in that province. I think the pith and substance of the legislation now before us is entirely different. Its object and purpose is the protection of white women and girls; and the prohibition of their employment or residence, or lodging, or working, etc., in any place of business or amusement owned, kept or managed by any Chinaman is for the purpose of ensuring that protection. Such legislation does not, in my judgment, come within the class of legislation or regulation which the Judicial Committee held ultra vires of the provincial legislatures in the case of The Union Collieries v. Bryden, [1899] A.C. 580. The right to employ white women in any capacity or in any class of business is a civil right, and legislation upon that subject is clearly within the powers of the provincial legislatures. The right to guarantee and ensure their protection from a moral standpoint is, in my opinion, within such provincial powers and, if the legislation is bona fide for that purpose, it will be upheld even though it may operate prejudicially to one class or race of people. There is no doubt in my mind that the prohibition is a racial one and that it does not cease to operate because a Chinaman becomes naturalized. It extends and was intended to extend to all Chinamen as such, naturalized or aliens. Questions which might arise in cases of mixed blood do not arise here. The Chinaman prosecuted in this case was found to have been born in China and of Chinese parents and, although, at the date of the offence charged, he had become a naturalized British subject, and had changed his political allegiance, he had not ceased to be a \"Chinaman\" within the meaning of that word as used in the statute. This would accord with the interpretation of the word \"Chinaman\" adopted by the judicial committee in the case of The Union Colliery Company v. Bryden, [1899] A.C. 580. The prohibition against the employment of white women was not aimed at alien Chinamen simply or at Chinamen having any political affiliation. It was against \"any Chinaman\" whether owing allegiance to the rulers of the Chinese Empire, or the United States Republic, or the British Crown. In other words, it was not aimed at any class of Chinamen, or at the political status of Chinamen, but at Chinamen as men of a particular race or blood, and whether aliens or naturalized. For these reasons I would dismiss the appeal with costs. \r\n\r\nIDINGTON, J. (dissenting) : The legislature of Saskatchewan, by ch. 17 of the statutes of 1912, intituled An Act to prevent the Employment of Female Labour in certain capacities enacted as follows :-\r\n\r\n1. No person shall employ in any capacity any white woman or girl or permit any white woman or girl to reside or lodge in or to work in or, save as a bona fide customer in a public apartment thereof only, to frequent any restaurant, laundry or other place of business or amusement owned, kept or managed by any Japanese, Chinaman or other Oriental person ; \r\n\r\nwhich is followed by a penal clause under which appellant has been convicted. That conviction has been maintained by the Supreme Court of Saskatchewan in a judgment from which the learned Chief Justice of that Court dissented.\r\n\r\nThe first question raised is whether or not the appellant, who is admitted to have been born in China, of Chinese parents but was at the time of the alleged offence a naturalized British subject, falls within the Act. It is quite clear that the term \"any Chinaman\" may, in the plain, ordinary sense of the words, be so construed as to include naturalized British subjects. It is, to my mind, equally clear that, having regard to many considerations, to some of which I am about to advert, a proper and effective meaning may be given to this term without extending it to cover the naturalized British subject.\r\n\r\nThe Act, by its title, refers to female labour and then proceeds to deal with only the case of white women. In truth, its evident purpose is to curtail or restrict the rights of Chinamen. In view of the provisions of the Naturalization Act, under and pursuant to which the appellant, presumably, has become a naturalized British subject, one must have the gravest doubt if it ever was intended to apply such legislation to one so naturalized.\r\n\r\nThe Naturalization Act, in force long before and at the time of the creation of the Province of Saskatchewan, and ever since, provided by section 4 for aliens acquiring and holding real and personal property, and by sec. 24, as follows: 24. An alien to whom a certificate of naturalization is granted shall, within Canada, be entitled to all political and other rights, powers and privileges, and be subject to all obligations to which a natural-born British subject is entitled or subject within Canada, with this qualification, that he shall not, when within the limits of the foreign state of which he was a subject previously to obtaining his certificate of naturalization, be deemed to be a British subject unless he has ceased to be a subject of that state in pursuance of the laws thereof, or in pursuance of a treaty or convention to that effect.\r\n\r\nThese enactments rest upon the class No. 25 of the classification of subjects assigned, by sec. 91 of the British North America Act, 1867, to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion Parliament, and which reads as follows: Naturalization and Aliens.\r\n\r\nThe political rights given any one, whether naturalized or natural-born British subjects, may in many respects be limited and varied by the legislation of a province, even if discriminating in favour of one section or class as against another. Some political rights or limitations thereof may be obviously beyond the power of such legislature. But the \"other rights, powers and privileges\" (if meaning anything) of natural-born British subjects to be shared by naturalized British subjects, do not so clearly fall within the powers of the legislatures to discriminate with regard to as between classes or sections of the community.\r\n\r\nIt may well be argued that the highly prized gifts of equal freedom and equal opportunity before the law, are so characteristic of the tendency of all British modes of thinking and acting in relation thereto, that they are not to be impaired by the whims of a legislature; and that equality taken away unless and until forfeited for causes which civilized men recognize as valid. For example, is it competent for a legislature to create a system of slavery and, above all, such a system as applied to naturalized British subjects? This legislation is but a piece of the product of the mode of thought that begot and maintained slavery; not so long ago fiercely claimed to be a laudable system of governing those incapable of governing themselves.\r\n\r\nAgain, it may also be well argued that, within the exclusive powers given to the Dominion Parliament over the subject of naturalization and aliens, there is implied the power to guarantee to all naturalized subjects that equality of freedom and opportunity to which I have adverted. And I ask, has it not done so by the foregoing provision of the Naturalization Act?\r\n\r\nIt is quite clear that, if the Dominion Government so desire, it can, by the use of the veto power given it over all local provincial legislation insist upon the preservation of this equality of freedom and opportunity.\r\n\r\nIt is equally clear that a casual consideration of this Saskatchewan Act might not arrest the attention of those whose duty it is to consider and determine whether or not any provincial Act should be vetoed. It might well be that, in regard to such an Act respecting aliens, those discharging the duty relative to the veto power might let it go for what it might be worth, knowing that, as to them, Parliament could later intervene; whereas other considerations might arise as to naturalized subjects and the duty to protect those naturalized be overlooked by reason of the general term used.  \r\n\r\nIt may be that the guarantee which I incline to think is implied in the Naturalization Act covers the ground. If so, there is then in this Act that which, as applied to the appellant (a naturalized subject) is ultra vires the legislature.  \r\n\r\nIf so, this conviction falls to the ground. Much stress is laid, on the one hand, upon the expression of opinion in the judgment of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council in the case of The Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden, [1899] A.C. 580, and, on the other hand, in that in the judgment of the same Court in the case of Cunningham v. Tomey Homma, [1903] A.C. 151.  \r\n\r\nI may observe that a decision is only binding for that which is necessary to the decision of the case and add that, perhaps, neither expression of opinion now relied upon by the respective parties hereto was actually necessary for the determination of the case. Perhaps neither decision, in itself, can be said to be conclusive by way of governing the questions to be resolved herein. But of the two the former, certainly, so far as one can gather from the report, touches more nearly or directly the point involved in the present inquiry.  \r\n\r\nOf course, such opinions, even if obiter dicta, are entitled to that weight to be given such eminent authority. What was clearly decided in the first case was that such comprehensive language as used in the regulation in question and, I rather think, aimed chiefly at alien Chinamen, was ultra vires, and, in the other, that the political right to vote was something within the express power of the legislature to give or withhold or restrict as it should see fit. This later point in no way touches what is raised herein.  \r\n\r\nWith the very greatest respect, I submit that the obiter dictum, relative to the limitations of the power existent in the Dominion Parliament by virtue of the assignment to it of paramount legislative authority over the subject of \"naturalization and aliens\" never was intended to be treated or taken in the sense now sought to be attributed to it, and, if bearing such implication, that it is not maintainable.  \r\n\r\nCanada, for example, is deeply interested as a whole and always has been in the colonization of its waste lands by aliens expecting to become British subjects, and surely the power over naturalization must involve in its exercise many considerations relative to the future status of such people as invited to go there and accept the guarantees and inducements offered them. To define and forever determine beyond the power of any legislature to alter the status of such people and measure out their rights by that enjoyed by the native-born seems to me a power implied in the power over \"naturalization and aliens.\" Many incidental powers have, as something implied in the other powers, contained in the same category, been held as attached thereto or to be used as part thereof with less excuse for the implication of incidental power there in question than would be involved in going a good deal further than I suggest in the execution of this power over \"naturalization and aliens\" the Dominion Parliament may go.\r\n\r\nSome of these guarantees might depend on conventions with other powers, and I should hesitate to hamper the exercise of the power by any such limitations thereon as a provincial legislature might think fit to impose. That power must be treated as the other powers categorically assigned to Parliament by section 91 of the B.N.A. Act, 1867, in a wide and statesmanlike fashion. All these considerations have, in a measure, been observed in the provisions of the Naturalization Act, and in framing the provisions I have quoted and other like provisions. No one can, as of right, become naturalized. He must reside for three years in this country and thus become known to those who have to aid in his qualifying himself by shewing that he is of good character. Unless and until he fulfil these conditions he cannot come within the class to which appellant belongs.  \r\n\r\nThe appellant having, under the Naturalization Act (as I think fair to infer) become a British subject, he has presumably been certified to as a man of good character and enjoying the assurance, conveyed in section thereof which I have quoted, of equal treatment with other British subjects, I shall not willingly impute an intention to the legislature to violate that assurance by this legislation specially aimed at his fellow-countrymen in origin. Indeed, in a piece of legislation alleged to have been promoted in the interests of morality, it would seem a strange thing to find it founded upon a breach of good faith which lies at the root of nearly all morality worth bothering one's head about.  \r\n\r\nHaving regard to all the foregoing considerations and the further consideration that this is a penal statute and, therefore, to be read and construed according to the principle applicable to such like statutes, I think this is one of the relatively few instances in which we can depart from the cardinal rule of interpreting all documents, including statutes, according to the plain ordinary reading of the language used, and, with Bowen, L.J., in Wandsworth Board of Works v. United Telephone Co., 13 Q.B.D. 904, ask ourselves if these words so read are capable of two constructions and, if so, say :- \r\n\r\nIt is wise to adopt such a construction as is based upon the assumption that Parliament merely intended to give so much power as was necessary for carrying out the objects of the Act, and not to give any unnecessary powers.  \r\n\r\nOr say, with Keating, J., in Boon v. Howard (in 1874), L.R. 9 C.P. 277, at 308 : \r\n\r\nIf the words are susceptible of a reasonable and also of an unreasonable construction, the former construction must prevail.  \r\n\r\nOther like cases are collected in Hardcastle (3rd ed.), at 174 et seq.  \r\n\r\nLooked at from this point of view I am constrained to think that this Act must be construed as applicable only to those Chinamen who have not become naturalized British subjects, and is not applicable to the appellant who has become such.  \r\n\r\nWhether it is ultra vires or intra vires the alien Chinamen is a question with which, in this view, I have nothing to do.  \r\n\r\nYet, in deference to the argument put forward in way of so interpreting the British North America Act that the reservation to Parliament at the end of sec. 91 of the powers enumerated in said section 91 must apply only in its limitation to item number 16 of sec. 92, instead of as usually construed, so far as necessary to each and all of the enumerated powers given by that section, I may be permitted to say that I wholly dissent from the view put forward. I look upon the powers given Parliament in the twenty-nine enumerated classes set forth in sec. 91, so far as necessary to give efficacy thereto, as paramount to anything contained elsewhere as in sec. 92.  \r\n\r\nSubject thereto, and some other special powers given Parliament, the powers given the legislatures are exclusive and cannot be infringed upon or restricted save by the veto power. There is, however, the possibility of legislation by a legislature being held good until Parliament asserts its powers in conflict therewith.  \r\n\r\nUntil this relation of the powers respectively given Parliament and the legislatures and their order of priority and superiority is thoroughly comprehended and acted upon, there is sure to be confusion in working the system and that confusion invites and induces still greater confusion when the place of the residual power has to be fixed and the relation thereof to these considered.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of the warehouse receipts given banks by virtue of the Bank Act, as against local legislation resting upon authority over property and civil rights, as held in Tennant v. The Union Bank of Canada, [1894] A.C. 31, illustrates how unfounded is the argument put forward. And the case of the Grand Trunk Railway Company v. The Attorney-General of Canada, [1907] A.C. 65, relative to the power of a railway company to contract itself out of the provision of the Railway Act, prohibiting such a contract with its employees, is another illustration of how the law of a province, quite good till Parliament asserted its power, by virtue of sec. 91, sub-sec. 29, must bend before such assertion of superior power.  \r\n\r\nThe fact that Parliament has, in regard to naturalization, intervened, has much weight with me in reaching the conclusion I have as a reason why the legislature must not be presumed to have decided to ignore what is enacted by Parliament.  \r\n\r\nI am by no means to be held as deciding the effect of that legislation by Parliament. All I say, in way of deciding herein, is that until, in such case, the legislature makes it clear that it intended to question the effect of that legislation, I need go no further than say it has not clearly expressed its intention to assert and exercise such a doubtful right.  \r\n\r\nIt is an attempt to cover and classify by an ambiguous term the case of a man who is in truth and fact what the term used clearly implies, and may return home any day, with that of a man who may have bid good-bye forever to his native land, induced to do so by the assurances offered him. I may add that we are not instructed as to the exact relation between China and Great Britain in regard to the position of the appellant, and, for the present purpose, that is immaterial, but I can conceive of further considerations of this sort of legislation rendering more full information necessary than this case does. And, if the like term \"Chinaman,\" as used here and in The Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden, [1899] A.C. 580, is to be read as extending to such, when naturalized British subjects, then the decision therein must bind us herein.  \r\n\r\nI think, therefore, that this appeal should be allowed with costs.  \r\n\r\nQUONG WING v. DUFF, J.: The first question to be considered is a question of jurisdiction which was raised during the course of the argument. The appeal comes before us by leave, under sec. 37 (c), Duff, J. but an order made under that provision does not conclude the question of jurisdiction which arises here. Sec. 36, sub-sec. \"b,\" provides in express terms that there shall be \"no appeal in a criminal case except as provided in the Criminal Code.\" In the judgments of three members of the Court in Re McNutt, 47 Can. S.C.R. 259, 10 D.L.R. 834, 21 Can. Cr. Cas. 157, 49 C.L.J. 117, the word \"criminal,\" as it appears in sec. 39, sub-sec. \"c\" (and it is obviously used in the same sense in sub-sec. \"a,\" sec. 36) was construed in the broad sense as applying to proceedings for the punishment of offences under provincial penal enactments, which, if passed by a legislature exercising authority unrestricted as to subject-matter would, according to the general principles, be classified as criminal law. See pages 261, 267, and 286.  \r\n\r\nIf these views correctly interpret the word \"criminal\" in sec. 39(c), it would follow, I think, that the appeal in the present case comes within the prohibitions of sec. 36(b), and is incompetent.  \r\n\r\nFor reasons, however, which I gave in full, Re McNutt, 47 Can. S.C.R. 259, 10 D.L.R. 834, 21 Can. Cr. Cas. 157, 49 C.L.J. 117, I think the phrases \"criminal case\" and \"criminal charge\" in these provisions of the Supreme Court Act must be read in the narrow sense there indicated, and in my view the prohibitions contained in sub-sec. \"a\" and \"b,\" of sec. 36, have no application to judgments in proceedings under provincial penal statutes.  \r\n\r\nThe statute in question came into force on May 1, 1912, and is in the following words:  \r\n\r\nNo person shall employ in any capacity any white woman or girl or permit any white woman or girl to reside or lodge in or to work in or, save as a bona fide customer in a public apartment thereof only, to frequent any restaurant, laundry or other place of business or amusement owned, kept or managed by any Japanese, Chinaman or other Oriental person.\r\n\r\nAny employer guilty of any contravention or violation of this Act shall, upon summary conviction, be liable to a penalty not exceeding $100 and, in default of payment, to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two months.  \r\n\r\nThis Act shall come into force on the first of May, 1912.  \r\n\r\nOn May 27, 1912, the appellant, who was a restaurant keeper, was convicted by the police magistrate of Moose Jaw of the offence of employing white female servants in contravention of the provisions of this Act. On January 11, 1913, the Act was amended by striking out the italicized words in the last two lines of sec. 1, its application being thereby limited to \"Chinamen.\"  \r\n\r\nThe appellant, at the time of the alleged offence, had been naturalized under the naturalization laws of Canada.  \r\n\r\nThe first question for consideration, which is the substantial question on the appeal, is whether, assuming that this statute is not in conflict with any Act passed by the Parliament of Canada, it is within the scope of the legislative powers of the Province of Saskatchewan.  \r\n\r\nIt might plausibly be contended that it is legislation in relation to any one of these three classes of subjects: \"local undertakings,\" sec. 92 (B.N.A. Act), item 10, or \"property and civil rights\" within Saskatchewan, sec. 92(13), or \"matters merely local or private\" in Saskatchewan, sec. 92(16). For the purposes of this judgment it may be assumed that the words \"any. restaurant, laundry or other place of business or amusement\" are not in this enactment descriptive of \"local works or undertakings\" within the meaning of sec. 92(10); and I shall assume further that (although the legislation does unquestionably deal with civil rights) the real purpose of it is to abate or prevent a \"local evil\" and that considerations similar to those which influenced the minds of the Judicial Committee in The Attorney-General of Manitoba v. The Manitoba License-Holders' Association, [1902] A.C. 73, lead to the conclusion that the Act ought to be regarded as enacted under sec. 92(16), \"matters merely local or private within the province,\" rather than under sec. 92 (13), \"property and civil rights within the province.\" There can be no doubt that, prima facie, legislation prohibiting the employment of specified classes of persons in particular occupations on grounds which touch the public health, the public morality or the public order from the \"local and provincial point of view\" may fall within the domain of the authority conferred upon the provinces by sec. 92(16).  \r\n\r\nSuch legislation stands upon precisely the same footing in relation to the respective powers of the provinces and of the Dominion as the legislation providing for the local prohibition of the sale of liquor, the validity of which legislation has been sustained by several well-known decisions of the Judicial Committee, including that already referred to.  \r\n\r\nThe enactment is not necessarily brought within the category of \"criminal law,\" as that phrase is used in sec. 91 of the B.N.A. Act, 1867, by the fact merely that it consists simply of a prohibition and of clauses prescribing penalties for the non-observance of the substantive provisions. The decisions in Hodge v. The Queen, 9 App. Cas. 117, and in the Attorney-General for Ontario v. The Attorney-General for the Dominion, [1896] A.C. 348, as well as in the Attorney-General of Manitoba v. The Manitoba License-Holders' Association, [1902] A.C. 73, already mentioned, established that the provinces may, under sec. 92 (16) of the B.N.A. Act, 1867, suppress a provincial evil by prohibiting simpliciter the doing of the acts which constitute the evil or the maintaining of conditions affording a favourable milieu for it, under the sanction of penalties authorized by sec. 92 (15).  \r\n\r\nThe authority of the legislature of Saskatchewan to enact this statute now before us is disputed upon the ground that the Act is really and truly legislation in relation to a matter which falls within the subject assigned exclusively to the Dominion by sec. 91(25), \"aliens and naturalization,\" and to which, therefore, the jurisdiction of the province does not extend. This is said to be shown by the decision of the Privy Council in The Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden, [1899] A.C. 580.  \r\n\r\nI think that, on the proper construction of this Act (and this appears to me to be the decisive point), it applies to persons of the races mentioned without regard to nationality. According to the common understanding of the words \"Japanese, Chinaman or other Oriental person,\" they would embrace persons.\r\n\r\nPrima facie, therefore, the Act is not an Act dealing with aliens or with naturalized subjects as such. It seems also impossible to say that the Act is, in its practical operation, limited to aliens and naturalized subjects. From the figures given by the census of 1911 it appears that, while the total Chinese population of the three western provinces was about 22,000, there were about 1,700 persons born in Canada classed as Chinese, nearly all of whom would be found in those provinces; and these, of course, are natural born subjects of His Majesty. There are at this moment in Western Canada, moreover, considerable numbers of people unquestionably embraced within the description \"Oriental persons\" who have come to this country from other parts of His Majesty's territorial dominions and as regards nationality stand in the same category. The Act would (giving its words their usual meaning) apply to all these; and there can be no sound reason for suggesting that they can, consistently with the objects of the enactment, be excluded from the field of its operation.\r\n\r\nThe appellant's attack is really based upon a certain interpretation of the decision of their Lordships by the Judicial Committee in The Union Colliery Co. v. Bryden, [1899] A.C. 580. Lord Watson, in delivering their Lordships' judgment, at p. 587, said:  \"But the leading feature of the enactments consists in this-that they have, and can have, no application except to Chinamen who are aliens or naturalized subjects, and that they establish no rule or regulation except that these aliens or naturalized subjects shall not work, or be allowed to work, in underground coal mines within the province of British Columbia. They are also of the opinion that the whole pith and substance of the enactments or section 4 of the Coal Mines Regulation Act, in so far as objected to by the appellant company, consists in establishing a statutory prohibition which affects aliens or naturalized subjects, and, therefore, trench upon the exclusive authority of the Parliament of Canada.\"\r\n\r\nOf the legislation before us it would be impossible to say that \"it has and can have no application except to 'Orientals' who are aliens or naturalized subjects,\" as I have already pointed out. It seems equally impossible to affirm that it establishes any rule or regulation at all comparable to regulations of the character described by His Lordship, viz., \"that these aliens or naturalized subjects shall not work or be allowed to work in certain industries,\" and, lastly, it would be going quite beyond what is warranted by anything like a fair reading of the statute before us to say of it that \"it establishes no rule or regulation laying a prohibition upon aliens or naturalized subjects.\"\r\n\r\nOrientals are not prohibited in terms from carrying on any establishment of the kind mentioned. Nor is there any ground for supposing that the effect of the prohibition created by the statute will be to prevent such persons carrying on any such business. It would require some evidence of it to convince me that the right and opportunity to employ white women is, in any business sense, a necessary condition for the effective carrying on by Orientals of restaurants and laundries and like establishments in the Western provinces of Canada. Neither is there any ground for supposing that this legislation is designed to deprive Orientals of the opportunity of gaining a livelihood.\r\n\r\notherwise answering the description who, as being born in British territory (Singapore, Hong Kong, Victoria or Vancouver, for instance), are natural born subjects of His Majesty equally with persons of other nationalities. The terms Chinaman and Chinese, as generally used in Canadian legislation, point to a classification based upon origin, upon racial or personal characteristics and habits, rather than upon nationality or allegiance. The Chinese Immigration Act, for example, R.S.C., 1906, ch. 95 (sec. 2 (d) and sec. 7), particularly illustrates this; and the judgment of Mr. Justice Martin, Re The Coal Mines Regulation Act, 10 B.C.R. 408, at pp. 421 and 428, gives other illustrations. Indeed, the presence of the phrase \"other Oriental persons\" seems to make it clear, even if there could otherwise have been any doubt upon the point, that the legislature is not dealing with these classes of persons according to nationality, but as persons of a certain origin or persons having certain common characteristics and habits sufficiently indicated by the language used.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing in the Act itself to indicate that the legislature is doing anything more than attempting to deal according to its lights (as it is its duty to do) with a strictly local situation. In the sparsely inhabited Western provinces of this country the presence of Orientals in comparatively considerable numbers not infrequently raises questions for public discussion and treatment, and, sometimes in an acute degree, which in more thickly populated countries would excite little or no general interest. One can without difficulty figure to one's self the considerations which may have influenced the Saskatchewan Legislature in dealing with the practice of white girls taking employment in such circumstances as are within the contemplation of this Act; considerations, for example, touching the interests of immigrant European women, and considerations touching the effect of such a practice upon the local relations between Europeans and Orientals; to say nothing of considerations affecting the administration of the law. And, in view of all this, I think, with great respect, it is quite impossible to apply with justice to this enactment the observation of Lord Watson in the Bryden case, [1899] A.C. 580, that \"the whole pith and substance of it is that it establishes a prohibition affecting\" Orientals. For these reasons, I think, apart altogether from the decision in Cunningham v. Tomey Homma, [1903] A.C. 151, to which I am about to refer, that the question of the legality of this statute is not ruled by the decision in Bryden's case.\r\n\r\nI think, however, that in applying Bryden's case we are not entitled to pass over the authoritative interpretation of that decision which was pronounced some years later by the Judicial Committee itself in Cunningham v. Tomey Homma, [1903] A.C. 151. The legislation their Lordships had to examine in the last mentioned case, it is true, related to a different subject-matter. Their Lordships, however, put their decision upon grounds that appear to be strictly appropriate to the question raised on this appeal. Starting from the point that the enactment then in controversy was prima facie within the scope of the powers conferred by sec. 92(1), they proceeded to examine the question whether, according to the true construction of sec. 91 (25), the subject-matter of it really fell within the subject of \"aliens and naturalization\"; and, in order to pass upon that point, their Lordships considered and expounded the meaning of that article.\r\n\r\nAt pp. 156 and 157, Lord Halsbury, delivering their Lordships' judgment, says:  If the mere mention of alienage in the enactment could make the law ultra vires, such a construction of section 91, sub-section 25, would involve that absurdity. The truth is that the language of that section does not purport to deal with the consequences of either alienage or naturalization. It undoubtedly reserves these subjects for the exclusive jurisdiction of the Dominion-that is to say, it is for the Dominion to determine what shall constitute either the one or the other, but the question as to what consequences shall follow either is not touched. The right of protection and the obligations of allegiance are necessarily involved in the nationality conferred by naturalization; but the privileges attached to it, where these depend upon residence, are quite independent of nationality.\r\n\r\nIt was hardly disputed that if this passage stood alone the argument of the appellant must fail. But it is said that this passage is obiter and is inconsistent with and, indeed, contradictory to certain passages in Lord Watson's judgment in Bryden's case, [1899] A.C. 580, which passages, it is contended, give the true ground of the decision in that case and, consequently, are binding upon us. I have already said what I have to say as to the effect of Lord Watson's judgment; but I think this last mentioned argument is completely answered by reference to a subsequent passage of Lord Halsbury's judgment in Cunningham's case, [1903] at p. 157. It is as follows: \r\n\r\nThat case depended upon totally different grounds. This Board dealing with the particular facts of the case, came to the conclusion that the regulations there impeached were not really aimed at the regulation of coal mines at all, but were in truth devised to deprive the Chinese, naturalized or not, of the ordinary rights of the inhabitants of British Columbia and, in effect, to prohibit their continued residence in that province, since it prohibited their earning their living in that province.\r\n\r\nThat is an interpretation of Bryden's case, [1899] A.C. 580, which it appears to me to be our duty to accept.\r\n\r\nIt should not be forgotten that the very eminent Judges (Lord Halsbury, Lord Macnaghten, Lord Lindley), constituting the Board which heard the appeal in Cunningham's case, [1903] A.C. 151, had that case before them for something like six months after it had been very fully argued by Mr. Blake against the provincial view; and, in delivering the considered judgment of the Board, Lord Halsbury, as we have seen, examines and sums up the effect of the decision in Bryden's case, [1899] A,C. 580, which the Courts in British Columbia had believed themselves to be following in passing upon Cunningham's case, [1903] A.C. 151. In these circumstances, whatever might otherwise have been one's view of their Lordships' judgment in Bryden's case, [1899] A.C. 580, we should not be entitled to adopt and act upon a view as to the construction of item 25 of sec. 91 (B.N.A. Act), which was distinctly and categorically rejected in the later judgment.  \r\n\r\nThere is one more point to be noted. Section 24 of the Naturalization Act, ch. 77, of the R.S.C., 1906, provides as follows:  An alien to whom a certificate of naturalization is granted shall, within Canada, be entitled to all political and other rights, powers and privileges, and be subject to all obligations, to which a natural-born British subject is entitled or subject within Canada, with this qualification that he shall not, when within the limits of the foreign state of which he was a subject previously to obtaining his certificate of naturalization, be deemed to be a British subject, unless he has ceased to be a subject of that state in pursuance of the laws thereof, or in pursuance of a treaty or convention to that effect.  \r\n\r\nIt is unnecessary to consider whether or not this section goes beyond the powers of the Dominion in respect of the subject of naturalization, or whether \"the rights, powers and privileges\" referred to therein ought to be construed as meaning those only which are implied by the \"protection\" that is referred to as the correlative of allegiance in the passage above quoted from the judgment of the Judicial Committee in Cunningham's case, [1903] A.C. 151. This much seems clear: The section cannot fairly be construed as conferring upon persons naturalized under the provisions of the Naturalization Act, a status in which they are exempt from the operation of laws passed by a provincial legislature in relation to the subjects of sec. 92 of the British North America Act, 1867, and applying to native-born subjects of His Majesty in like manner as to naturalized subjects and aliens. If the enactment in question had been confined to Orientals who are native-born British subjects it would have been impossible to argue that there was any sort of invasion of the Dominion jurisdiction under sec. 91 (25); and it seems equally impossible to say that this legislation deprives any Oriental, who is a naturalized subject, of any of \"the rights, powers and privileges\" which an Oriental, who is a native-born British subject, is allowed to exercise or retain.  \r\n\r\nANGLIN, J., agreed with Davies, J.  \r\n\r\nAppeal dismissed with costs.  \r\n\r\nN.B.Leave to appeal was refused by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, May 19, 1914."
