    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Among all techniques, **text embeddings** have emerged as a powerful tool for analyzing texts and their underlying meanings. Text embeddings are numerical representations of words, sentences, or documents that capture their semantic and contextual meanings. They allow us to analyze texts in a more efficient and effective way, enabling us to uncover patterns and relationships that may not be immediately apparent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Studying legal texts can be a challenging task for historians, especially when it comes to analyzing the stance of historical figures towards specific groups or certain events only based on legal discourse. Text embeddings can potentially help us to overcome this challenge by providing a way to analyze the texts in a more nuanced and sophisticated manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will focus on the ***Regina V Wing Chong (1885)***-- a legal case in British Columbia that pronounced the Chinese Regulation Act of 1884 unconstitutional-- to analyze the stance of Crease towards Chinese immigrants in British Columbia, while introducing the concept and application of text embeddings. We also encourage you to discuss the results you see and critically reflect on the limitations of text embeddings in historical analysis. Hopefully, this will inspire you to think about how machine learning can be used to analyze other historical texts and uncover the underlying meanings and relationships within them."

    "### Data Exploration\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin our analysis, we collected a dataset of 10 documents related to Chinese immigrants problems in British Columbia, Canada, specifically focusing on the legal cases involving Justice Crease, including *Regina V Wing Chong (1885)*, *Wong Hoy Woon V Duncan (1894)* and his answer to the inquiry at the Royal Commission on Chinese Immigrants in 1885. For comparison, we also included legal cases involving other judges such as Justice Begbie and Justice Fitzpatrick, and other reports made at the Royal Commission on Chinese Immigrants. Among which, we focus on Begbie as a reference level for comparison, as he was known for his more lenient stance towards Chinese. We also included the original text of the *Chinese Regulation Act, 1884* as another reference level for comparison, as it was a significant piece of discriminatory legislation against Chinese immigrants in British Columbia.\n",
    "\n",
    "We prepared our dataset using a technique called **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** to convert scanned legal documents into machine-readable text. This process involved several steps: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Finding the scanned documents from sources such as the Law Society of British Columbia Court Report and Canadian Legal Information Institute. \n",
    "2. We used OCR models such as [Nanonets OCR](https://huggingface.co/nanonets/Nanonets-OCR-s) and [Azure AI Vision](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/products/ai-services/ai-vision) to extract text from these scanned images, ensuring that the text was as accurate as possible through prompt tuning and script optimization. \n",
    "3. We cleaned the extracted text manually to remove any artifacts or errors introduced during the OCR process. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, due to the nature of OCR, some errors may still persist, which we acknowledge as a limitation of our dataset, and we welcome contributions to improve the dataset."

It is in a tabular format with columns for the filename, author, type of the document and text content. To refine our analysis, we also removed direct quotations of the *Chinese Regulation Act, 1884* in other documents to avoid bias. The number of quotes sentences removed is also recorded in the dataset. "

    "**Zero-shot classification** is a technique that allows us to classify text into predefined categories without the need for labeled training data. It uses a pre-trained model to generate embeddings for the text and then compares the embeddings to the predefined categories to determine the most likely category for each text. We typically have two strategies for zero-shot classification: First, tokenize by sentences and then classify each sentence individually, or second, chunk the text into overlapping windows and classify each window.\n",

We begin by creating a dictionary to hold the full text of each author."
