## A purely numerical interpretation of the texts

Imagine we wanted to analyze a vast archive of historical texts from a given time period. Specifically, say we wanted to understand which terms are used most frequently in each document-- perhaps this could give us an indication as to what themes appear most frequently within the texts, or help narrow down our search for specific texts on specific topics. If we just looked at which words were most popular in each text, that wouldn't really tell us anything; our most popular terms would just be "and"s and "the"s. What we can instead do is look at which words, in a given document, are most popular **relative to the words in the other documents**. For example, if we suspect that Judge Henry Crease spoke primarily sbout migrant workers through an economic lens rather than a social one, we'd expect him to use more economic language than social language when discussing foreign worker rights, relative to other judges such as Judge Matthew Baillie Begbie.

Okay, we're picking up on some of the specific themes surrounding each author's corpus (begbie's pawnbroker case, for instance), but this isn't telling us much of anything. We need a less general approach.

## Word embeddings

What if, instead of just calculating how many times each word appears in a text and penalizing the word if it appears in other texts, we could create a multi-dimensional "map", that contains every single word from the historical texts we're studying. Instead of latitude and longitude, each word is given a set of coordinates that represents its meaning in the collection of texts. These coordinates are generated via a computer by reading all of the sentences, and learning each word's meaning through it's surrounding in-text context. 

Going back to the tf-idf example, words that are used in similar ways, like "china," "alien," and "chinese", are placed very close together in the same "neighborhood" on the map. In contrast, words like "statute" and "legistlature" are placed close together, but are much further away from "china," "alien," and "chinese". The key here for historians is that the neighbors of a given word reveal the implicit associations of a given word within the text it's from. For instance, if we were to map a collection of
