"14th & 15th July, Certiorari—“Chinese Regulation Act, 1884,” s. ... Act, 1867, ss. 91, 92—“Aliens”—“Trade and Commerce”—Taxation. On the return to a writ of certiorari. Held, that the “Chinese R...vires of the Provincial Legislature, on the following grounds:","Crease, J.","Case Headnote - Chinese Regulation Act 1884, certiorari"
"1. It is an interference with the rights of Aliens.","Crease, J.","Constitutionality - Aliens"
"2. It is an interference with Trade and Commerce.","Crease, J.","Constitutionality - Trade and Commerce"
"3. It is an infraction of the existing treaties between the Imperial Government and China.","Crease, J.","Treaty Obligations"
"4. It imposes unequal taxation.","Crease, J.","Equality in Taxation"
"14th & 15th July—On the return of a writ of certiorari directed to Edwin Johnson, Esquire, Police Magistrate, at Victoria, testing the legality of a license issued under the “Chinese Regulation Act, 1884.”","Crease, J.","Case Context - Certiorari facts"
"The Attorney-General in support of the conviction said there were five points raised on the rule for the certiorari against the validity of the $10 tax.—1st. That it interfered with the Dominion powers under the B.N.A. Act over aliens and naturalization, 2nd, with trade and commerce, 3rd, with treaty obligations, 4th, was unequal and 5th was indirect taxation.","Attorney-General","Constitutionality – Dominion powers (Aliens, trade, treaty, taxation)"
"*Richards*, Q. C., for Wing Chong—The object of the Act was not to raise revenue but to exert the same power to regulate trade and commerce with foreign countries.","Richards, Q.C.","Statutory Interpretation - Regulatory purpose vs revenue (Trade and Commerce)"
"*Drake*, Q. C., on the same side, argued that the imposition of the tax was invidiously discriminatory, being aimed solely against Chinese—for instance, it elevates their coppers to one dollar—or, in other words, “demonetizing” them.","Drake, Q.C.","Equality in Taxation - Discrimination against Chinese"
"The Attorney-General in reply—The ten dollar impost was a tax, but its proper construction was that it was a general provincial license or excise tax on Chinese, for raising provincial revenue; and that, though it indirectly affected aliens, no legislative power of the Dominion was invaded, since each Province is autonomous within the bounds of its jurisdiction.","Attorney-General","Constitutionality – Provincial taxation power"
"21st August, 1885—CREASE, J.— In order to deal satisfactorily with the controversy between the parties as to whether laws are required for the government of the Province to raise money by direct taxation or for any other reason, it is necessary to understand the provisions of the statute under consideration. The Act proceeds to enact:—","Crease, J.","Judicial Reasoning – Introduction to judgment"
"1. The title.","Crease, J.","Statute Reference - Chinese Regulation Act, 1884, section 1"

"Section 3—with which we are immediately concerned—says:—'From and after the passing of this Act, every person of the Chinese race shall, before going to work in any mine or on any claim, take out in the manner hereinafter provided a license, to be issued by the collector for such Chinese person, and pay such Chinese person a further sum of ten dollars.'","Crease, J.","Statute Reference - Chinese Regulation Act, 1884, section 3"
"Sec. 4 provides for the appointment and payment of special collectors, and enacts that no collector or assistant shall perform the duties of both, nor a collector of one district perform those of another.","Crease, J.","Statute Reference - Chinese Regulation Act, 1884, section 4"
"By Sec. 5 'Any Chinese who shall be found within the Province without having taken out a license in the form hereinafter provided, shall, on conviction thereof, forfeit and pay a sum not exceeding forty dollars.'","Crease, J.","Statute Reference - Chinese Regulation Act, 1884, section 5"

"By Sec. 8 'Every employer of Chinese shall furnish to the collector, at or before the end of every month, a list in writing, verified by oath, of all Chinese employed by him within the district of the collector during the preceding month, and shall produce to the collector every license in the employer's possession or control; and the collector may, in the absence of such list and licenses, make due enquiry to ascertain the correctness of the statements in the list he does produce.'","Crease, J.","Statute Reference - Chinese Regulation Act, 1884, section 8"

'In case any employer of Chinese fails to deliver his list as required by this Act, every employer so failing shall be liable, on summary conviction, to imprisonment for not less than one month and not exceeding two calendar months.'","Crease, J.","Statute Reference - Chinese Regulation Act, 1884, section 9"
"Section 10 gives the collector power to 'levy the amount of the fines, penalties, or forfeitures incurred under this Act on any property of the offender, and if the amount thereof be not paid, he may distrain, sell, and dispose of such property; and if the goods be perishable, he may summarily sell them; and in either case the costs of sale and proceedings may be deducted from the proceeds.'","Crease, J.","Statute Reference - Chinese Regulation Act, 1884, section 10"

"Section 16 amends the License Ordinance of 1867 by adding those ominous words, 'but no license shall be issued to any Chinese.'","Crease, J.","Statute Reference - Chinese Regulation Act, 1884, section 16"
"Sections 17 and 18 prevent the exhumation of dead bodies without proper authority, and prohibit the use of opium except for medical purposes.","Crease, J.","Statute Reference - Chinese Regulation Act, 1884, sections 17-18"
"Section 19 provides for the recovery of any pecuniary penalty by seizure or sale of goods, and failing that, imprisonment for not exceeding three months.","Crease, J.","Statute Reference - Chinese Regulation Act, 1884, section 19"
"Section 20 (amended by Act of 1885) declares that 'convictions are not to be quashed for want of form.'","Crease, J.","Statute Reference - Chinese Regulation Act, 1884, section 20"
"Section 21. 'Any Chinese who shall lend his license or free miner's certificate to another shall be liable on summary conviction to a fine of not less than twenty dollars nor more than one hundred dollars.'","Crease, J.","Statute Reference - Chinese Regulation Act, 1884, section 21"
"Section 22 enacts that the tribunal applied to may decide 'on evidence and judgment' whether any person is a Chinese or fourteen years old.","Crease, J.","Statute Reference - Chinese Regulation Act, 1884, section 22"

"Section 27 places in the hand of the local executive the control of the Act; and section 30 terms it merely 'The Chinese Regulation Act, 1884.'","Crease, J.","Statute Reference - Chinese Regulation Act, 1884, section 27"
"The only schedule is the form of license, which runs as follows:—","Crease, J.","Case fact - license schedule form"
"1. That it interfered with the Dominion powers under the B.N.A. Act over aliens and naturalization.","Crease, J.","Issue 1 - Aliens/Naturalization (Constitutionality)"
"2. Trade and commerce.","Crease, J.","Issue 2 - Trade and Commerce (Constitutionality)"
"3. Treaty obligations.","Crease, J.","Issue 3 - Treaty Obligations"
"4. That the tax was unequal.","Crease, J.","Issue 4 - Equality in Taxation"
"5. That it was indirect taxation and therefore illegal, and should be quashed.","Crease, J.","Issue 5 - Indirect Taxation"
"On the first point, I would observe that it is now well settled that the B.N.A. Act of 1867, which is, indeed, the constitution of Canada, cannot be altered or amended by the provincial legislatures.","Crease, J.","Constitutional Law - BNA Act as supreme constitution"
"Neither she nor any other of the Provinces possess any taxation power other than that given by the constitution or by delegated authority.","Crease, J.","Constitutional Law - Provincial taxation power (limitation)"
"The Act of Federation was passed in order to be an irrefragable charter of the Dominion, unalterable save by concurrence of Dominion and Provincial Legislatures; and the provinces are as bound by the provisions of the British North America Act, 1867 as the Dominion.","Crease, J.","Constitutional Law - Intent of Federation (provincial limitations)"
"The exclusive powers of that Act given to the Dominion over particular subjects must yield and govern; it is therefore the duty of this Court to so adjudge any local law clashing with them.","Crease, J.","Constitutional Law - Federal paramountcy (Dominion powers over provinces)"
"And the converse of this is true when applied to the exclusive subjects given by the constitution to the Province: these the Dominion legislature cannot touch.","Crease, J.","Constitutional Law - Provincial sovereignty (exclusive powers)"
"Now, applying this test to the statute before us, let us see whether any of its provisions affect, as is alleged, aliens, or trade, or commerce.","Crease, J.","Statutory Interpretation - Division of powers analysis"
"The aliens in this case being Chinese, the first enquiry must be whether the legislature which passed the Act of 1867 has power, under the B.N.A. Act, to prevent the immigration of Chinese.","Crease, J.","Constitutional Law - Immigration/Aliens (Provincial competence)"
"That Act [Chinese Population Act, 1871] was disallowed. It interfered with aliens, and (so far as China was concerned) would have a tendency to prohibit their introduction.","Crease, J.","Case Law Reference - Chinese Population Act 1871 (disallowed)"
"Another statute (of 1878), 'An Act to provide for the better regulation and government of the people of China coming to this Colony,' was also disallowed, and its provisions acted on by the government as conclusive.","Crease, J.","Case Law Reference - Chinese Population Act 1878 (disallowed)"
"The position and legislative powers of British Columbia have been defined by the Imperial authority. The decision in Hodge v. Queen, reported L.R. 9 App. Cas. 117, is law here and binding on this Court.","Crease, J.","Case Law Reference - Hodge v. Queen (provincial powers precedent)"
"Their lordships say (page 132), with reference to the objection of the appellants there (delegatus non potest delegare):—'It appears to their lordships, however, that the objection urged with so much earnestness appears to be more metaphysical than practical; and *within the limits of subjects and area* the Local Legislature is supreme.'","Crease, J.","Case Law Quotation - Hodge v. Queen (JCPC) - delegation principle"
"[So far this decision confirms the words of Lord Selborne in Hodge's case, to whose construction Sir W. M. James here objects, by pointing out the method of carrying the enactment into operation and effect.]","Crease, J.","Case Law Quotation - Hodge v. Queen (JCPC) - continued"
"That decision, although in some respects an obiter dictum, is binding here until some superior authority has interfered with them so as to render it unconstitutional.","Crease, J.","Case Law Reference - Hodge v. Queen (binding precedent)"
"Aliens may be taxed, they may be subjected to the same rules and resident taxes as other inhabitants: such is the language of an old Canadian case (cited by the Attorney-General before me in this case, dissenting).","Crease, J.","Case Law Quotation - Aliens and taxation (dissenting opinion quote)"
"Commerce cannot be carried on without the aid and agency of persons and their property. Indeed, commerce is dependent on persons; and if the means of commerce could be cut off, the commerce itself might be destroyed. The point of contact between commerce and person or property is vital.","Crease, J.","Case Law Quotation - Cooley v. Board of Wardens (persons necessary for commerce)"
"The power asserted in the Act in question (the California Act of Congress) was such a power as to enable the people of the State to prevent the introduction of goods of different kinds from outside the limits of the State, and to defeat the commercial policy of the nation.","Crease, J.","Case Law Quotation - Cooley v. Board of Wardens (state vs federal powers)"
"That act could not be maintained as a police regulation; the general government has no right to interfere with its regulations (of California) in order to facilitate or hinder commerce, because to do so would be incompatible with the authority of the Government.","Crease, J.","Case Law Quotation - Chinese Exclusion Act case (Portland & Chinese Exclusion)"
"That the Chinese might be taxed as other residents, but could not contribute to the revenue of the State in the character of foreigners.","Crease, J.","Case Law Quotation - Chinese Exclusion Act cases (tax on aliens quote)"
"The reports of the higher California courts are of great authority in constitutional law as applicable to a federation of States.","Crease, J.","Judicial Note - Californian courts' decisions (analogous context)"
"Of course, in all the observations I make I recognize the notion that the analogy is so close as to become almost a direct authority is mistaken; they are only to be followed so far as they are analogous.","Crease, J.","Judicial Commentary - U.S. precedents persuasive only"
"In the *Lin Sin* judgment, p. 579, the learned judge says of the *Chinese exclusion case*, 'The Government could do by issuing its mandate closing its ports what it may not do by legislative enactment.'","Crease, J.","Case Law Quotation - Lin Sin v. Baker (foreign entry, government power)"
"And again: 'to determine whether there is a conflict or not, the true test *is the real and substantial effect* of the enactment.'","Crease, J.","Case Law Quotation - Lin Sin v. Baker (conflict/substantial effect test)"
"In another place he says:—'It would be an empty sound to say that the local legislature can regulate the entry of persons into the Province. What is that but saying that a sovereign province can compel such foreigners to depart as soon as they arrive?'","Crease, J.","Case Law Quotation - Lin Sin v. Baker (entry/exit rights)"
"And again, 'A tax imposed by the law on these persons (Chinese) for the purpose of discouraging their immigration into the State... is a casuistically the same law. That certainly is interfering with aliens.'","Crease, J.","Case Law Quotation - Chinese Exclusion Act cases (discouraging immigration by tax)"
"During the argument on the case before me, the Attorney-General asked, why should not this be treated as an ordinary provincial tax? If it were, then as such it would be collateral to the exclusive powers given to the Dominion. So stands the question.","Crease, J.","Argument Note - classification as tax (collateral question)"
"In another California case, *In re Tiburcio Parrott* (1878), it is held that if the end sought to be obtained by a statute is itself unlawful (invasion of a forbidden field), the statute is void, though its means might be allowable in some sense.","Crease, J.","Case Law Quotation - In re Tiburcio Parrott (state law void if object unlawful)"
"In *Russell v. Reg.* it is decided that the true nature and character of the 10s. additional tax is to be determined in order to ascertain its validity.","Crease, J.","Case Law Quotation - Russell v. Regina (BC, true nature test)"
"In *Citizens Insurance Co. v. Parsons*, we have to look at the legislation and the same object in construing the law for the same purpose.","Crease, J.","Case Law Quotation - Citizens Ins. Co. v. Parsons (1867, legislative purpose test)"
"If the legislation here be to drive the people of China from the country (and not to raise revenue), that is something which a casual observer would have no idea of.","Crease, J.","Statutory Interpretation - Hidden purpose (exclusion intent)"
"The treaties between Great Britain and China, which bind us, agree that Chinese subjects shall enjoy life, person, and property in British dominions as fully as British subjects; they secure to them perfect safety and security.","Crease, J.","Treaty Quotation - UK-China Treaty obligations (1860 treaty)"
"*Vattel*, cap. 8, referring to our obligations to foreigners: 'It follows that if it be the policy of the State to receive foreigners, it can only attach to that reception such obligations as do not materially impede the right of the State; it is bound to afford them perfect security as far as depends on it.'","Crease, J.","Authority Quotation - Vattel on treatment of aliens"
"*Reg. v. Severn* and *Reg. v. Russell* are important authorities which uphold that British subjects have certain rights; it is said Chinese enjoy them. These rights are what citizens enjoy here.","Crease, J.","Case Law Reference - R. v. Severn; R. v. Russell (rights of subjects)"
"These treaties have the force of international law, and are to be construed against the party for whose benefit they are introduced.","Crease, J.","Treaty Interpretation - Binding force and contra proferentem"
"In the case of the Chinese treaties, they were forced at the point of the sword; they impose no burden of forbidding the Chinese to trade and reside in British dominions everywhere.","Crease, J.","Treaty Context - 1858/1860 Chinese Treaties (history)"
"In the treaties of 1858 and 1860, made at the solicitation of the Chinese, it is provided that if any Chinese wish to trade as merchants or laborers, they may enter into engagements with British subjects for that purpose.","Crease, J.","Treaty Quotation - Chinese Treaties 1858/1860 (free trade clause)"
"These obligations are binding here and in other parts of the Empire; nothing is more certain in international law than that treaty obligations are not repealed by any Act in a part of the Empire without an express declaration.","Crease, J.","Treaty Interpretation - Obligations not overridden by statute"
"In the definition of the persons affected by the Act no distinction is made between British subjects and others; a license is required of any Chinese person. To deprive him of goods and liberty alike denies his rights.","Crease, J.","Statutory Interpretation - Broad alien definition (rights intrusion)"
"It is impossible but that such an imposition so enforced is an interference with aliens, trade, and commerce.","Crease, J.","Judicial Conclusion - Act interferes with aliens, trade, and commerce"
"If a man employ a Chinaman who should happen to be delinquent, he will not escape penalty, but must suffer as well as if it were done by himself or under his orders; after all this is the same law. That certainly is interfering with aliens.","Crease, J.","Case Law Quotation - Employment of aliens example"
"The proposition that it is a Provincial tax for revenue purposes is false; the legislature has chosen to use its taxing power to restrict Chinese, as punishment for remaining, risking penal consequences which the Act hangs over him.","Crease, J.","Statutory Interpretation - Provincial tax contention (revenue vs restriction)"
"For instance, by section 19 any pecuniary penalty imposed may extend to a month's imprisonment (or more) in addition; the employers would necessarily be white men affected by that, not the Chinese.","Crease, J.","Statutory Interpretation - Racial impact (employers affected)"
"In fact, the Act so bristles with arbitrary exceptions and penalties (ten years' imprisonment for an offense of which a Chinaman has little knowledge) that it subjects him to extreme hardship, even to hard labor.","Crease, J.","Statutory Interpretation - Arbitrary burdens (hard labor penalty)"
"The Act is so full of provisions that directly interfere with Dominion powers that it lies beyond the competence of the local legislature, and is consequently illegal and void.","Crease, J.","Judicial Ruling - Act ultra vires (Dominion powers)"
"So far, I have dealt with the Act on its own merits; but if any reasonable doubt remained, we would reject it, giving it the strict interpretation, and adjudge accordingly, and quash the conviction, with costs.","Crease, J.","Judicial Ruling - Disposition (conviction quashed)"
