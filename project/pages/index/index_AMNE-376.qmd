* These modules in particular are designed to be used in 1 or 2 one-hour long lab environments, with TA or Instructor supervision, or in a flipped classroom setting (i.e. as a lecture)
* They include a number of **exercises** which are intended to be formative (i.e. not graded) in nature, and can be addressed during the lab
* They can also be used for self-study, with some additional effort
