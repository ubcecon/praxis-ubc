This section contains material to support UBC's Constitutions in Canadian History: From Pre-Contact to the Charter of Rights (HIST 414).  This course covers European precedents, Colonial self-government, Canadian Confederation, and issues such as gay rights, abortion, and First Nations land rights. 

CHANGE

* These modules in particular are designed to be used in 1 or 2 one-hour long lab environments, with TA or Instructor supervision
* They can also be used for self-study, with some additional effort
