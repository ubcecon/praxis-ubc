Try out [getting started](../docs/1_Getting_Started/getting_started_intro_to_jupyter/getting_started_intro_to_jupyter.qmd) introduction to Jupyter notebook, then come back here.\n:::\n\nAs most of our experience is in post-secondary education, this guide is intended for educators teaching students at the university level.  However, it is probably also suitable for upper-year high school students, with sufficient experience^[We have taught several of these notebooks to 1st year students during intake events, who were fresh out of high school.].\n\n## Why Jupyter Notebooks? {#sec-why}\n\nWhy are Jupyter Notebooks a valuable tool for teaching?  There are two main reasons:\n\n* First, there are the advantages of _Notebooks_ for teaching.\n* Second, there are the advantages of _Jupyter_ for teaching.\n\nCombining these advantages creates a very valuable tool.\n\n### Why Notebooks?\n\nA _notebook_ refers to a digital document which combines rich text (including hyperlinks, formatting, and images) with cells that can perform computations.  A user is able to change the content of the notebook, such as performing a computation or changing the text.\n\nNotebooks teach students three important skills, useful for data science and applied social science research:\n\n1.  First, they teach students how to perform **literate coding**.  Literate programming dates back to @knuth1984literate, and has become extremely popular in sciences that use data.  As @kery2018story explains, combining notes and context with code creates a self-documenting research _notebook_ that addresses many common problems novice (and experienced) researchers face when analyzing data.\n2.  Second, they encourage **replicable** and **reproducible** data analysis.  The non-reproducability of empirical results (see @camerer2018evaluating) has reached crisis-levels in some fields.  Because notebooks need to be run from the top-down, they naturally encourage students to make their analyses replicable.  The structure of a notebook also encourage transparency when experimenting with analyses.  This makes the work more likely to be reproducible.\n3.  Third, they teach **industry-relevant** skills.  Notebooks are extensively used by employers who conduct data science research, or who use data science in their work.  Understanding how to write and use notebooks is a valuable skill in itself.\n\nThese properties make notebooks ideal to teach to students.  Creating notebooks for classroom instruction turns them from a research tool into a pedagogical tool.\n\n### Why Jupyter?\n \nJupyter is not the only option for notebooks (see @sec-alternatives).  However, it has some advantages for teaching not shared by alternatives:\n\n1.  **No installation necessary**: when used through a [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub), Jupyter notebooks do not require students to install any software or have a powerful computer.  Even students with just a Chromebook or tablet can use Jupyter notebooks.\n    * This eliminates many of the most time-consuming and frustrating parts of teaching student data science, including: installing software, troubleshooting package conflicts, issues sharing files and data, and computer problems.\n2.  **Simple Github integration**: through [`nbgitpuller`](https://nbgitpuller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) it is easy to share notebooks directly into a JupyterHub.  This means that starting a class using notebooks is as easy as sharing a link with your students.\n3.  **Language independence**: although the Jupyter framework is written in Python, it uses _kernels_ to perform computation.  There are [dozens of kernels available](https://gist.github.com/chronitis/682c4e0d9f663e85e3d87e97cd7d1624), including those for popular languages such as R, Julia, Java, C, STATA, and Python itself.\n\nThe biggest strength of Jupyter is its hub-based design.  This is also its biggest weakness, since it relies on an internet connection and someone to manage the hub.  However, there are many free, well-maintained, hubs online such as:\n\n* [UBC OpenJupyter](https://lthub.ubc.ca/guides/jupyterhub-instructor-guide/)\n* [Syzygy](https://syzygy.ca/)\n* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)\n* [GitHub Codespces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)\n\nYou can also [set up your own](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/quickstart.html), or work with non-profits like [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/) to develop your own hub.\n\n### What are the Alternatives? {#sec-alternatives}\n\nJupyter Notebooks are not the only option for teaching using notebooks.  In fact, there are significant advantages to other notebook styles, which may be more effective for certain kinds of teaching.\n\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n\n## Jupyter {.unnumbered}\n\n### Jupyter Notebooks {.unnumbered}\n\nJupyter notebooks are the most widely-used framework for notebook-based content, and are the easiest to use for students.  However, they are not always the easiest to develop or maintain.  **We recommend Jupyter for online and student use.**\n\n#### Advantages {.unnumbered}\n\n* Widely used, many tutorials and guides online.\n* No software installation needed for users.\n* Many public, free, hubs (including Google Collab).\n* Large, open-source community.\n \n#### Disadvantages {.unnumbered}\n\n* Complex and difficult local set-up.\n* `JSON`-based file type; hard to maintain.\n* Limited display and render options.\n\nLearn more about [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/).\n\n## Quarto {.unnumbered}\n\n### Quarto Notebooks {.unnumbered}\n\nQuarto is a strong improvement over R Markdown and supports multiple languages.  However, it is still in development and is more complicated.  **We recommend Quarto for development and offline use**^[We use Quarto to develop the COMET project.].\n\n#### Advantages {.unnumbered}\n\n* Interoperable with R Markdown, but not R specific.\n* Very rich output and render options.\n* Easy-to-install locally.\n* Default, enterprise-supported editor ([RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)).\n\n#### Disadvantages {.unnumbered}\n\n* No easy-to-use free hubs available.\n* More complex than comparable notebook formats.\n* New, still in development.\n\nLearn more about [Quarto](https://quarto.org/).\n\n## R Markdown {.unnumbered}\n\n### R Markdown Notebooks {.unnumbered}\n\nR Markdown is an excellent alternative to Jupyter for offline-only applications that only use R.\n\n#### Advantages {.unnumbered}\n\n* Very widely-used, many tutorials and guides online.\n* Easy-to-install locally.\n* Default, enterprise-supported editor ([RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/)).\n* Many render options for output, rich output.\n\n#### Disadvantages {.unnumbered}\n\n* Idiosyncratic syntax.\n* No easy-to-use free hubs available.\n* Only supports R coding, no other languages.\n\nLearn more about [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/).\n\n## Observable {.unnumbered}\n\n### Observable Notebooks {.unnumbered}\n\nObservable is the newest format on the market, and looks very professional.  It is designed for enterprise clients, and is the most complex of the alternatives.\n\n#### Advantages {.unnumbered}\n\n* Non-language specific framework.\n* Extremely rich output formats.\n* Strong dashboarding and interactive support.\n* Large enterprise developer.\n\n#### Disadvantages {.unnumbered}\n\n* Large enterprise developer, no free hubs.\n* Most complex of the alternatives.\n* New, still in development.\n\nLearn more about [Observable](https://observablehq.com/documentation/) and `D3.js`.\n\n:::\n\n\n## Teaching with Jupyter Notebooks\n\nWe have tried several ways of using Jupyter Notebooks when teaching, and found that they fit most teaching styles.  We have found them particularly effective in:\n\n* Lecture.\n* Flipped classrooms.\n* Workshops or labs.\n\nYou can find advice on lesson planning in these formats in the tabs below.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n## Lectures {.unnumbered}\n\n### Direct Instruction or Lectures {.unnumbered}\n\nJupyter notebooks are most effective in lecture when you use them as a _demonstration tool_ which students can follow along with.  \n\n* The power of a Jupyter notebook is the interactive nature of the different cells.\n* This allows you to enhance your lecture content by immediately and interactively demonstrating principles by running cells and changing their values.\n\nEssentially, you make can your slides or visualizations interactive by running or editing cells.\n\n* You can either do this directly, by showing the notebook, or you can turn the notebook into a slideshow using either `nbcovert` or [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#), which create a [RevealJS presentation](https://revealjs.com/) from your notebook.\n  * RevealJS is a powerful HTML-based presentation framework, widely used on the web and in computation.\n* There are also powerful libraries for interactive visualization, such as [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/python/) and [`ggplotly`](https://plotly.com/ggplot2/).^[Plotly comes in several flavours for different languages, such as [`plotly-r](https://plotly.com/r/)]\n\nSee @sec-rise for a guide to creating presentations using Jupyter notebooks.\n\nWe have found it is usually best to give students the Jupyter notebook of the presentation, as a kind of \"hand-out,\" while you demonstrate using the presentation display of the notebook.  This avoids the problem of having to make sure students have a suitable presentation display tool installed.\n\n### Suggestions for Teaching {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Try demonstrating a cell, then asking students to predict what happen when you make a different change.  Then do it!\n    * This works great with classroom response systems such as iClicker or TopHat.\n2.  Spend time thinking about how interacting with the cell can show the concept more effectively than a static visualization.\n    * We have found this to be particularly useful for dynamics in visualizations, such as showing a change.\n3.  Spend time on each interactive part of your presentation, and walk through the changes.\n4.  Use [encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)) by placing code in auxillary files to make the demonstrations easier to follow.\n    * If students don't need to know _how_ it works, only what it does, consider re-writing the code to hide the details.\n\n## Flipped Classroom {.unnumbered}\n\n### Flipped Classrooms {.unnumbered}\n\nA _flipped classroom_ refers to a teaching model where activities traditional done in the classroom are done at while, while activities done at home are done in the classroom (@akccayir2018flipped).  \"Flipping\" the lecture demonstration, outlined above, using Jupyter Notebooks is a natural fit.\n\nMost flipped classroom experiences tend to use videos (see @akccayir2018flipped), and this is quite feasible with Jupyter Notebooks.  Record yourself demonstrating the notebook, and have students follow along.  We can done this for some of the COMET notebooks (see [our project notebooks](../docs/Research/econ490-pystata/10_Combining_Graphs.ipynb) for example).\n\nHowever, the interactivity of notebooks makes them ideal for doing as \"pre-reading\" assignment instead, or in addition, to videos.  The active learning created by interacting with the notebook, and completing [self-test](@sec-selftests) exercises, makes them more effective than just doing a reading.\n\nA good flipped-classroom notebook:\n\n* Introduces the topic in a narrative, systematic way, and does not require any significant external references to follow along.\n* Includes regularly-spaced interactive cells, which require students to evaluate and inspect the results.\n* Has a series of self tests (see @sec-selftests) at regular intervals, to check and reinforce student understanding.\n\n### Suggestions for Teaching {.unnumbered}\n\nWhen in the classroom, we recommend following-up the notebook with a formative or summative assessment using the same skills, but in a new setting or in a more sophisticated way.\n\n* For example, you could assign students a pre-reading of [classification and clustering](../docs/4_Advanced/advanced_classification_and_clustering/advanced_classification_and_clustering.qmd) before class.  In the class, you could then introduce a new dataset and have them explore it using clustering methods.\n* Many of our COMET notebooks, especially the [intermediate ones](../docs/3_Intermediate/intermediate_multiple_regression/intermediate_multiple_regression.qmd) are built with this structure, where one \"Part\" of the notebook can be turned into the classroom part of the flipped classroom.^[This was actually our original use for the notebooks, before COMET! See @graves2024understanding]\n\n## Workshops or Labs  {.unnumbered}\n\n### Workshops or Labs  {.unnumbered}\n\nWe have also found it effective to teach using Jupyter notebooks in small group settings, such as workshops.  A typical Jupyter workshop in our experience:\n\n* Divide the students into groups of about 4-5, and have them physically move so that they are seated next to one another.\n  * This also works well online, using a feature like Zoom's breakout rooms.\n* Once they are settled, or before moving people into their breakout rooms, introduce the purpose of the workshop.  Identify what students are supposed to do, and how they will interact with the Jupyter Notebooks.\n* Allow students to work together on the notebooks, while you move around the room discussing with the groups.\n\nIt is often  effective to design your notebooks so that they have several identifiable \"tasks\" or stopping points, where you can bring the workshop back together.\n\n* Many of our COMET notebooks, especially the [intermediate ones](../docs/3_Intermediate/intermediate_multiple_regression/intermediate_multiple_regression.qmd) are built with this structure.\n* Make sure you build in time for students to introduce themselves to one another, if this is their first time meeting.\n\n### Suggestions for Teaching {.unnumbered}\n\nWhen in the classroom, we recommend following-up the notebook with a formative or summative assessment using the same skills, but in a new setting or in a more sophisticated way.\n\n* Many of the tools and techniques for flipped classroom instruction work well in a workshop format too.  Just make sure there is sufficient support so students can follow the notebooks together.\n* Encourage students to work together to troubleshoot problems if they encounter them, so you are not running around too often.\n* An effective strategy is to have the students collaborate on a single \"final\" version of the notebook together, while experimenting on their own.  Nominating one student as the \"scribe\" is a good way to keep this organized.\n\nAt the end of the workshop, having students hand in their Notebook is an effective way of measuring participation, and encourages participation.\n\n:::\n\n## Developing your own Notebooks for Teaching\n\nIt is easier than you might expect to develop notebooks for teaching.  Some of our favourite examples are:\n\n* [Word Embeddings](../docs/4_Advanced/advanced_word_embeddings/advanced_word_embeddings_python_version.qmd): an advanced, workshop-style, `.ipynb` format notebook.\n* [Visualization](../docs/2_Beginner/beginner_intro_to_data_visualization1/beginner_intro_to_data_visualization1.qmd): a basic, lecture-style, introduction with time for experimentation.\n* [Exporting Output](../docs/5_Research/econ490-stata/12_Exporting_Output.qmd): a flipped-classroom style book or workshop for STATA output.\n\nPoke around and see some more!\n\n### Presenting and Slideshows {#sec-rise}\n\nWhen teaching with Jupyter, effective presentation skills require a little planning.  There are several options, depending on what kind of presentation you want to give.\n\n#### Presenting a Notebook\n\nPresenting a Notebook as a notebook, such as in a demonstration or workshop, is easy.  \n\n* In [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), the easiest way is use the View menu:\n  * Uncheck all of the un-necessary bars, such as the top bar and status bar.\n  * Turn on \"Simple View\", which only shows your activate notebook tab.\n  * Turn on \"Presentation Mode.\"\n\nThis will create a large-format, interactive, version of your notebook suitable for presenting on an overhead projector or monitor.\n\n#### Presenting a Slideshow\n\nIf you want to turn your notebook into a slideshow, things are more complicated depending on whether you want it to be interactive or not.  However, in general you create a slideshow by designating individual cells are either whole slides, or fragments of slides:\n\n* A **slide** is a single higher-level slide.  When the presentation advances from one slide to another, it will \"slide\" right-to-left.\n* A **sub-slide** is like a lower-level slide.  When the presentations advances from to a sub-slide, it will \"slide\" from up-to-down.\n* A **fragment** is part of a slide.  It appears by sliding up, into the slide, keep the previous content visible.  This is how you can reveal information or advance content.\n\nYou designate cells as the different part of a presentation by clicking on the gear icon, then selecting the cell.  A dropdown menu that says \"Slide type\" will be visible.  Use this to set up your presentation.\n\nIf you don't care about interactivity, at this point you can go to \"File > Save and Export Notebook as...\" then select \"Reveal.js Slides.\"  This will download an `.html` file with your presentation in it.  Learn more about [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) to see how this file works in more detail.\n\nIf you want to run code in your presentation and edit it as you present, things are more complicated.  To make your presentation editable, you need to install [a JupyterLab extension](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/extensions.html) called [RISE](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/rise).\n\n* RISE is easiest to install on your own computer, not on a JupyterHub unless you have administrator privileges.\n* In the terminal, run `pip install jupyterlab_rise` then re-launch your server.\n* You can read more about RISE above; it's still in development so things might change.\n\n### Writing Self-Tests {#sec-selftests}\n\nWriting self-tests is an important part of providing formative feedback to students.  It can be somewhat complicated, but the basic idea is to write cells in your notebooks that look like:\n\n```r\n#an R self test\n\nanswer_1 <- #fill in the correct value here\n\ntest_1()\n```\n\nThe function `test_1()` is stored in an auxillary file, and performs a test on the answer.  It also gives feedback to the student, such as whether the answer was correct.\n\nThis requires some set-up, and is slightly different for different languages.  To make this easier, we provide a detailed guide for `R` and Python in our [writing self-tests documentation](documentation/writing_self_tests.qmd).\n\n\n### Development Tips \n\nDeveloping notebooks as a one-off is straightforward if you author them in JupyterLab: what you see is what you get.  However, if you have a more complex project some planning helps.  This includes multiple notebooks, or notebooks you need to collaborate on over time.\n\n* We strongly recommend **not** developing directly in `.ipynb` notebooks long term.  Draft your initial notebook in `.ipynb`, then switch to another framework for longer-term development.\n  * The reason is because editing an `.ipynb` edits the state of the program, making it easy to accidentally evaluate or delete something.\n  * It's also hard to maintain and doesn't play nicely with version control systems like [git](https://www.git-scm.com/) because the documents are very complicated in structure.\n* Our recommended format is `.qmd` which can render `.ipynb` notebooks from the source code.  The underlying document is just text, which makes it easy to edit and maintain.\n\nUsing `.qmd` notebooks is much easier: think of these as the \"source code\" and the `.ipynb` as the \"output.\"  This also has an advantage of begin able to create other output formats, like PDFs, websites, or presentations directly from the source code.\n\n## Teaching Offline\n\nWhile we think that teaching using a JupyterHub is the best option, that may not always be desired or possible.  If you want to use COMET notebooks, or similar teaching tools, without a JupyterHub you have two main options:\n\n* **Option 1**: have students install one of the [alternative frameworks](@sec-alternatives).\n* **Option 2**: have students install Jupyter locally, on their own computers.\n\nBe prepared to troubleshoot installation issues.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nYou can see some of our other publications on our [dissemination page](dissemination/dissemination.qmd).\n\n## References\n\n:::{#refs}\n:::","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n<!--\nFinally, we will be working on a “Teaching with Jupyter” guide to provide advice and support for instructors who are thinking about using Jupyter in their courses.

We have found them particularly effective in:\n\n* Lecture.\n* Flipped classrooms.\n* Workshops or labs.\n\nYou can find advice on lesson planning in these formats in the tabs below.\n\n::: {.panel-tabset}\n## Lectures {.unnumbered}\n\n### Direct Instruction or Lectures {.unnumbered}\n\nJupyter notebooks are most effective in lecture when you use them as a _demonstration tool_ which students can follow along with.  \n\n* The power of a Jupyter notebook is the interactive nature of the different cells.\n* This allows you to enhance your lecture content by immediately and interactively demonstrating principles by running cells and changing their values.\n\nEssentially, you make can your slides or visualizations interactive by running or editing cells.\n\n* You can either do this directly, by showing the notebook, or you can turn the notebook into a slideshow using either `nbcovert` or [RISE](https://rise.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#), which create a [RevealJS presentation](https://revealjs.com/) from your notebook.\n  * RevealJS is a powerful HTML-based presentation framework, widely used on the web and in computation.\n* There are also powerful libraries for interactive visualization, such as [`plotly`](https://plotly.com/python/) and [`ggplotly`](https://plotly.com/ggplot2/).^[Plotly comes in several flavours for different languages, such as [`plotly-r](https://plotly.com/r/)]\n\nSee @sec-rise for a guide to creating presentations using Jupyter notebooks.\n\nWe have found it is usually best to give students the Jupyter notebook of the presentation, as a kind of \"hand-out,\" while you demonstrate using the presentation display of the notebook.  This avoids the problem of having to make sure students have a suitable presentation display tool installed.\n\n### Suggestions for Teaching {.unnumbered}\n\n1.  Try demonstrating a cell, then asking students to predict what happen when you make a different change.  Then do it!\n    * This works great with classroom response systems such as iClicker or TopHat.\n2.  Spend time thinking about how interacting with the cell can show the concept more effectively than a static visualization.\n    * We have found this to be particularly useful for dynamics in visualizations, such as showing a change.\n3.  Spend time on each interactive part of your presentation, and walk through the changes.\n4.  Use [encapsulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encapsulation_(computer_programming)) by placing code in auxillary files to make the demonstrations easier to follow.\n    * If students don't need to know _how_ it works, only what it does, consider re-writing the code to hide the details.\n\n## Flipped Classroom {.unnumbered}\n\n### Flipped Classrooms {.unnumbered}\n\nA _flipped classroom_ refers to a teaching model where activities traditional done in the classroom are done at while, while activities done at home are done in the classroom (@akccayir2018flipped).  \"Flipping\" the lecture demonstration, outlined above, using Jupyter Notebooks is a natural fit.\n\nMost flipped classroom experiences tend to use videos (see @akccayir2018flipped), and this is quite feasible with Jupyter Notebooks.  Record yourself demonstrating the notebook, and have students follow along.  We can done this for some of the COMET notebooks (see [our project notebooks](../docs/Research/econ490-pystata/10_Combining_Graphs.ipynb) for example).\n\nHowever, the interactivity of notebooks makes them ideal for doing as \"pre-reading\" assignment instead, or in addition, to videos.  The active learning created by interacting with the notebook, and completing [self-test](@sec-selftests) exercises, makes them more effective than just doing a reading.\n\nA good flipped-classroom notebook:\n\n* Introduces the topic in a narrative, systematic way, and does not require any significant external references to follow along.\n* Includes regularly-spaced interactive cells, which require students to evaluate and inspect the results.\n* Has a series of self tests (see @sec-selftests) at regular intervals, to check and reinforce student understanding.\n\n### Suggestions for Teaching {.unnumbered}\n\nWhen in the classroom, we recommend following-up the notebook with a formative or summative assessment using the same skills, but in a new setting or in a more sophisticated way.\n\n* For example, you could assign students a pre-reading of [classification and clustering](../docs/4_Advanced/advanced_classification_and_clustering/advanced_classification_and_clustering.qmd) before class.  In the class, you could then introduce a new dataset and have them explore it using clustering methods.\n* Many of our COMET notebooks, especially the [intermediate ones](../docs/3_Intermediate/intermediate_multiple_regression/intermediate_multiple_regression.qmd) are built with this structure, where one \"Part\" of the notebook can be turned into the classroom part of the flipped classroom.^[This was actually our original use for the notebooks, before COMET! See @graves2024understanding]\n\n## Workshops or Labs  {.unnumbered}\n\n### Workshops or Labs  {.unnumbered}\n\nWe have also found it effective to teach using Jupyter notebooks in small group settings, such as workshops.  A typical Jupyter workshop in our experience:\n\n* Divide the students into groups of about 4-5, and have them physically move so that they are seated next to one another.\n  * This also works well online, using a feature like Zoom's breakout rooms.\n* Once they are settled, or before moving people into their breakout rooms, introduce the purpose of the workshop.  Identify what students are supposed to do, and how they will interact with the Jupyter Notebooks.\n* Allow students to work together on the notebooks, while you move around the room discussing with the groups.\n\nIt is often  effective to design your notebooks so that they have several identifiable \"tasks\" or stopping points, where you can bring the workshop back together.\n\n* Many of our COMET notebooks, especially the [intermediate ones](../docs/3_Intermediate/intermediate_multiple_regression/intermediate_multiple_regression.qmd) are built with this structure.\n* Make sure you build in time for students to introduce themselves to one another, if this is their first time meeting.\n\n### Suggestions for Teaching {.unnumbered}\n\nWhen in the classroom, we recommend following-up the notebook with a formative or summative assessment using the same skills, but in a new setting or in a more sophisticated way.\n\n* Many of the tools and techniques for flipped classroom instruction work well in a workshop format too.  Just make sure there is sufficient support so students can follow the notebooks together.\n* Encourage students to work together to troubleshoot problems if they encounter them, so you are not running around too often.\n* An effective strategy is to have the students collaborate on a single \"final\" version of the notebook together, while experimenting on their own.  Nominating one student as the \"scribe\" is a good way to keep this organized.\n\nAt the end of the workshop, having students hand in their Notebook is an effective way of measuring participation, and encourages participation.\n\n:::\n\n## Developing your own Notebooks for Teaching\n\nIt is easier than you might expect to develop notebooks for teaching.  Some of our favourite examples are:\n\n* [Word Embeddings](../docs/4_Advanced/advanced_word_embeddings/advanced_word_embeddings_python_version.qmd): an advanced, workshop-style, `.ipynb` format notebook.\n* [Visualization](../docs/2_Beginner/beginner_intro_to_data_visualization1/beginner_intro_to_data_visualization1.qmd): a basic, lecture-style, introduction with time for experimentation.\n* [Exporting Output](../docs/5_Research/econ490-stata/12_Exporting_Output.qmd): a flipped-classroom style book or workshop for STATA output.\n\nPoke around and see some more!\n\n### Presenting and Slideshows {#sec-rise}\n\nWhen teaching with Jupyter, effective presentation skills require a little planning.  There are several options, depending on what kind of presentation you want to give.\n\n#### Presenting a Notebook\n\nPresenting a Notebook as a notebook, such as in a demonstration or workshop, is easy.  \n\n* In [JupyterLab](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), the easiest way is use the View menu:\n  * Uncheck all of the un-necessary bars, such as the top bar and status bar.\n  * Turn on \"Simple View\", which only shows your activate notebook tab.\n  * Turn on \"Presentation Mode.\"\n\nThis will create a large-format, interactive, version of your notebook suitable for presenting on an overhead projector or monitor.\n\n#### Presenting a Slideshow\n\nIf you want to turn your notebook into a slideshow, things are more complicated depending on whether you want it to be interactive or not.  However, in general you create a slideshow by designating individual cells are either whole slides, or fragments of slides:\n\n* A **slide** is a single higher-level slide.  When the presentation advances from one slide to another, it will \"slide\" right-to-left.\n* A **sub-slide** is like a lower-level slide.  When the presentations advances from to a sub-slide, it will \"slide\" from up-to-down.\n* A **fragment** is part of a slide.  It appears by sliding up, into the slide, keep the previous content visible.  This is how you can reveal information or advance content.\n\nYou designate cells as the different part of a presentation by clicking on the gear icon, then selecting the cell.  A dropdown menu that says \"Slide type\" will be visible.  Use this to set up your presentation.\n\nIf you don't care about interactivity, at this point you can go to \"File > Save and Export Notebook as...\" then select \"Reveal.js Slides.\"  This will download an `.html` file with your presentation in it.  Learn more about [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) to see how this file works in more detail.\n\nIf you want to run code in your presentation and edit it as you present, things are more complicated.  To make your presentation editable, you need to install [a JupyterLab extension](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/extensions.html) called [RISE](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/rise).\n\n* RISE is easiest to install on your own computer, not on a JupyterHub unless you have administrator privileges.\n* In the terminal, run `pip install jupyterlab_rise` then re-launch your server.\n* You can read more about RISE above; it's still in development so things might change.\n\n### Writing Self-Tests {#sec-selftests}\n\nWriting self-tests is an important part of providing formative feedback to students.  It can be somewhat complicated, but the basic idea is to write cells in your notebooks that look like:\n\n```r\n#an R self test\n\nanswer_1 <- #fill in the correct value here\n\ntest_1()\n```\n\nThe function `test_1()` is stored in an auxillary file, and performs a test on the answer.  It also gives feedback to the student, such as whether the answer was correct.\n\nThis requires some set-up, and is slightly different for different languages.  To make this easier, we provide a detailed guide for `R` and Python in our [writing self-tests documentation](documentation/writing_self_tests.qmd).\n\n\n### Development Tips \n\nDeveloping notebooks as a one-off is straightforward if you author them in JupyterLab: what you see is what you get.  However, if you have a more complex project some planning helps.  This includes multiple notebooks, or notebooks you need to collaborate on over time.\n\n* We strongly recommend **not** developing directly in `.ipynb` notebooks long term.  Draft your initial notebook in `.ipynb`, then switch to another framework for longer-term development.\n  * The reason is because editing an `.ipynb` edits the state of the program, making it easy to accidentally evaluate or delete something.\n  * It's also hard to maintain and doesn't play nicely with version control systems like [git](https://www.git-scm.com/) because the documents are very complicated in structure.\n* Our recommended format is `.qmd` which can render `.ipynb` notebooks from the source code.  The underlying document is just text, which makes it easy to edit and maintain.\n\nUsing `.qmd` notebooks is much easier: think of these as the \"source code\" and the `.ipynb` as the \"output.\"  This also has an advantage of begin able to create other output formats, like PDFs, websites, or presentations directly from the source code.\n\n## Teaching Offline\n\nWhile we think that teaching using a JupyterHub is the best option, that may not always be desired or possible.  If you want to use COMET notebooks, or similar teaching tools, without a JupyterHub you have two main options:\n\n* **Option 1**: have students install one of the [alternative frameworks](@sec-alternatives).\n* **Option 2**: have students install Jupyter locally, on their own computers.\n\nBe prepared to troubleshoot installation issues.\n\n## Further Reading\n\nYou can see
