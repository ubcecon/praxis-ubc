Jupyter is an open-source, cloud-based system for creating interactive computational content (called \"\"notebooks\"\") which is widely used in both industry and academia.  It supports all standard computational languages, including R, STATA, Python, and Julia and has several advantages over more traditional tools.  In particular, it  facilitates the \"\"literate computing” framework – which synthesizes analysis, discussion, and conceptualization to allow students to interact with econometric concepts and analyses in a way which is accessible to learners with different levels of expertise.  We have used this tool in several sections at our institutions and are currently developing an open-source library of instructional tools for classroom use for our faculty members.\n--->\n\nIn this talk, I will discuss our work developing interactive Jupyter notebooks to help students learn applied econometrics.\n\n![Our open-source project: COMET [comet.arts.ubc.ca](https://comet.arts.ubc.ca/)](media/logo_1.png)\n\n## Outline\n\n1.  What are Jupyter Notebooks?\n    * What are some alternatives?\n    * What are the advantages?\n2.  How can I use them to teach econometrics?\n    * What is our project?\n    * What are some strategies for using them?\n3.  How can I use them for assessment?\n\n## What is a Notebook?\n\nA _notebook_ is a digital document which combines rich text (including hyperlinks, formatting, and images) with cells that can perform computations.  Examples include:\n\n* Jupyter Notebooks\n* RMarkdown Notebooks\n* Observable or D3.js\n\n**Key Feature**: a user is able to interact with the content of a notebook, such as performing a computation or changing the text.\n\n---\n\n![An example of a Jupyter notebook](media/example1.png)\n\n## Why Notebooks? {.smaller}\n\nNotebooks teach economics students three important skills:\n\n1.  **Literate programming**. Popular framework for data analysis (@knuth1984literate), and creates self-documenting tools that address common problems novice (and experienced) researchers face when analyzing data (@kery2018story).\n\n2.  **Replicable** and **reproducible** data analysis (@camerer2018evaluating).  Notebooks encourage replicable programming practices by design, and transparency with  experimentation.\n\n\n3.  **Industry-relevant**.  Notebooks are extensively used by employers who conduct data science research, or who use data science in their work.\n\nCreating notebooks for classroom instruction turns them from a research tool into a pedagogical tool.\n\n## What is Jupyter?\n\n[Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/) is on open-source project to support interactive data science and scientific computing.\n\n* Users connect to a central server, called a [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub), which runs _kernels_ that perform computations.\n  * Or: users can run the server locally on their own PC.\n* Users interact with the notebooks by editing or running **cells** which contain different kinds of content.\n\n---\n\n![Interactive areas in a Jupyter notebooks](media/example2.png)\n\n## Why Jupyter?\n\nJupyter has some advantages for teaching not shared by alternatives:\n\n1.  **No installation necessary** when used through a [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub), Jupyter notebooks do not require install any software or a powerful computer.\n2.  **Simple Github integration**: through [`nbgitpuller`](https://nbgitpuller.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) starting a class is as easy as sharing a link.\n3.  **Language independence**: computational kernels available for all major languages (R, STATA, Python, Julia, etc.)\n\n## Public or Free Hubs\n\nWhere do you find a hub?  You have options:\n\n* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/): [colab.research.google.com](https://colab.research.google.com/)\n* [GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/features/codespaces)\n* [Syzygy](https://syzygy.ca/): [syzygy.ca](https://syzygy.ca/)\n\nYou can also [set up your own](https://jupyterhub.readthedocs.io/en/stable/tutorial/quickstart.html), or work with non-profits like [2i2c](https://2i2c.org/) to develop your own hub.\n\n## What are the Alternatives? {#sec-alternatives}\n\nJupyter Notebooks are not the only option for teaching using notebooks and there can be advantages to other notebook formats:\n\n* Quarto Notebooks ([quarto.org](https://quarto.org/)): offline or multi-format\n* RMarkdown ([rmarkdown.rstudio.com](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)): R programming\n* Observable ([observablehq.com](https://observablehq.com/)): dashboards\n\n**Note**: these formats can be converted back and forth.\n\n## How to Use for Teaching?\n \nWe have tried several ways of teaching using Jupyter Notebooks, and found that they fit most teaching styles.  We have found them particularly effective in:\n\n* Lecture.\n* Flipped classrooms.\n* Workshops or labs.\n\nHowever, the _way_ you use them and the design of the notebooks differ.\n\n## Lecture and Demonstrations \n\nJupyter notebooks are most effective in lecture when you use them as a demonstration tool which students can follow along:\n\n* The power of a Jupyter notebook is the interactive nature of the different cells.\n* This allows you to enhance your lecture by running cells and changing their values to demonstrate principles.\n\n---\n\n:::{.callout-tip}\n## Example\n\n* Try demonstrating a cell, then asking students to predict what happen when you make a different change. Then do it!\n* This works great with classroom response systems such as iClicker or TopHat.\n:::\n\n\n## Workshops, Labs, and Flipped Classrooms {.smaller}\n\n“Flipping” (@akccayir2018flipped) the lecture demonstration, as discussed, using Jupyter Notebooks is a natural fit.\n\n* The interactivity of notebooks makes them ideal for setting as a “pre-reading” assignment.\n* You can also embed interactive \"self-tests\" into the notebook, to check student understanding (and completion)\n* In class, you can then do a more complex example or application.\n\nThis also works well for small workshops, TA-led labs, or self-study.\n\n## Assessment\n\nJupyter Notebooks also make effective assessments:\n\n* Self-tests, combined with hash functions, make good assignments or exams.\n* We have used a custom JupyterHub with a Lockdown Browser to carry out computational exams in a \"bring your own device\" set-up.\n  * Can be set-up to distribute and collect exams.\n  * Works well with Chromebook-based computer labs.\n\nThere are also Jupyter-based assessment systems such as `nbgrader` or `ottergrader`.\n\n\n## Further Reading\n\n* All of our teaching and learning materials are **free** and **open-source**.\n* You can find a copy of this presentation and all the links on our website.\n* If you want to get involved or collaborate send me an email: <jonathan.graves@ubc.ca>\n\n:::{.centering}\n**<https://comet.arts.ubc.ca/dissemination>**\n\nThank you!\n:::\n\n## References\n\n:::{#refs}\n:::","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n## Pitch: A Common Situation\n\nHave you ever:\n\n* Wanted to show students some cool patterns in data?\n* Needed to teach students how to do basic coding?\n* Tried to demonstrate a new econometric technique or something?\n\nThis is a _major_ learning context in any course which deals with or teaches data and computation.\n\n## Problem\n\nHowever, this is way harder to do than it should be:\n\n* Your students need computers that can run the material...\n* They need to have the right software...\n* They need to know how to use it: maybe code in it?\n* You need to share the learning materials with them.\n\nThese are all major points of failure.\n\n## Introduction\n\n\n<!--\nIn this talk, we will present our work exploring the use of Jupyter to teach and assess learning in intermediate and introductory econometrics courses.
