Topics include:\n\n* Descriptive statistics\n* Probability\n* Estimation\n* Hypothesis testing\n* Analysis of Variance\n* Simple and multiple regression\n* Time series analysis\n* Simultaneous equation estimation\n* Difference in Differences\n \nModules can be accessed on the left-hand side of this page. They are written as [JupyterNotebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and can be viewed in their `.html` form via a browser, or by downloading them in `.ipynb` form and launching them in a [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub). If you are affiliated with UBC, you can do this directly from the website via UBC’s in-house JupyterHub called [JupyterOpen](https://open.jupyter.ubc.ca/) for which these modules were designed. PIMS offers a non-UBC specific JupyterHub called [Syzygy](https://syzygy.ca/) if you are at another institution or JupyterOpen goes down.\n\nLaunching the notebooks in a JupyterHub will allow you to run the code for yourself, complete the exercises and get automatic feedback throughout your learning. Please let us know if you have any problems - you can submit an issue to our [GitHub directory](https://github.com/ubcecon/comet-project) if you find something that you think could be improved.
