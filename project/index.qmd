## About prAxIs
![](media/banner-light.png)

**prAxIs** is a [Large Teaching and Learning Enhancement Fund (TLEF)](https://tlef.ubc.ca/) project started at the [University of British Columbia](https://www.ubc.ca/) in 2025 that seeks to bring Machine Learning and AI into arts classes at UBC. 

Based at UBC’s [**Vancouver School of Economics**](https://economics.ubc.ca/) and the [**Centre for Computational Social Science**](https://ccss.arts.ubc.ca/), our team consists of **faculty** and **students** working in partnership to develop **hands-on learning modules** that explore the disciplinary application of AI and machine learning tools in Arts.

### <span style="color:#CC7A00" > For Learners </span>
These modules cover different applications of AI or machine learning in the context of a particular discipline or course.  Current courses include:

* HIST 414
* AMNE 170
* AMNE 376
* SOCI 415
* SOCI 217
* SOCI 280
* ECON 227  

Modules can be accessed from the menus at the top of the page.  They come in different formats, but most are written as interactive [JupyterNotebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and can be viewed in their `.html` form via a browser, or by downloading them in `.ipynb` form and launching them in a [JupyterHub](https://jupyter.org/hub). If you are affiliated with UBC, you can do this directly from the website via UBC’s in-house JupyterHub called [JupyterOpen](https://open.jupyter.ubc.ca/) for which these modules were designed. PIMS offers a non-UBC specific JupyterHub called [Syzygy](https://syzygy.ca/) if you are at another institution or JupyterOpen goes down.

Launching the notebooks in a JupyterHub will allow you to run the code for yourself and complete the exercises on your own. Please let us know if you have any problems - you can submit an issue to our [GitHub directory](https://github.com/ubcecon/comet-project) if you find something that you think could be improved. Happy learning!

### <span style="color:#CC7A00" > For Educators </span>

This project aims to develop and pilot a set of discipline-specific educational modules designed to demystify AI for undergraduate students in the Faculty of Arts.  Each application is packages as a "module" for a particular discipline.  These modules show students that AI tools can be used to better understand their discipline, and why a critical understanding of these tools is necessary to use them well.  They provide guidance and lessons plans for implementing these tools in the classroom, and explain what infrastructure and tools are needed.

In each module, students undertake a small, discipline-specific project that uses AI tools to address pertinent questions or challenges in their fields of study. Modules will include a theoretical component, designed to complement the application. This includes detailed, but non-technical, explanations of how these tools are constructed, how they function, and how they can be applied in academic research and industry, as well as critical discussion of their development and use.

We are driven to champion accessibility in our creation of these modules by publishing an open-source library of educational resources for broad instructional needs with the hope of lowering software costs and hardware requirements for students and learning institutions.

We welcome any feedback on how our project might be more accessible. This can be done by submitting an issue to our [GitHub directory](https://github.com/ubcecon/praxis-ubc).
