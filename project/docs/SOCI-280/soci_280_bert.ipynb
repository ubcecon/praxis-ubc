        "\n",
        "**Disinformation** is defined as being deliberately false information, created with the intention to mislead it's reader. Disinformation has been weaponized since the early middle ages: for example, in the 19th century, New Ywork-based newspaper *The Sun* published a series of articles, about the discovery of life on the Moon, with the purpose of increasing sales of *The Sun*. The papers claimed that, using a massive telescope, an english astronomer had discovered vegetation, bipedal beavers, and human-like aliens, dubbed \"man-bats\", that were four feet tall, had wings, and could fly (Zielinski, 2015). Whether-or-not the *great Moon Hoax* lead to *The Sun* becoming a successfull paper remains uncertain; some accounts claim that the series of papers brought *The Sun* to international fame, however it's likely that rumors of *The Sun*'s hoax increasing the paper's circulation were exaggerated. \n",

        "This is an example of a (mostly) harmless disinformation campaign; However, disinformation campaigns can, and have, been used instead to sway public opinion on critical matters. For example, during the Cold War, the KGB orchestrated a widespread disinformation campaign, alledging that HIV/AIDs was a bioeapon engineedred by the United States, in an effort to stoke global mistrust of public health authorities and foster anti-americanism (Selvage & Nehring, 2019). A particularly relevant example is political elections: State-sponsored Russian actors have mounted disinformation campaigns in ever single US federal election since 2016, at the latest. In 2016, for instance, the Russian state-sponsored Internet Research Agency (IRA) ran hundreds of facebook and Twitter groups that amplified divisive content, and organized astroturf rallies in key US states, most notably Pennsylvania (Menn and Dave, 2018). The extent to which these coordinated campains influenced the 2016 United-States election remains unclear: initial findings by the DOJ suggested that Russia coordinated a sweeping, large scale multi-million dollar online campaign aimed to praise Donald Trump and disparage Hillary Clinton (Muller, 2019). However, multiple studies have found that even under generous assumptions about presuasion rates, the vote-shifts caused by the IRA's disinformation campaigns were too small to sway the election's outcome (Allcot & Gentzkow, 2017, Eady et al., 2023). \n",
        "\n",
        "With the rise of digital platforms and generative AI, the scale, speed, and sophistication of disinformation have grown exponentially. From elections and pandemics to social justice movements and international conflicts, false or misleading content is being spread online to manipulate emotions and polarize public opinion. The challenge today is not just the volume of disinformation, but how convincing and targeted it has become. Former U.S. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines describes how state-sponsored campaigns, like Russia’s Kremlin, now operate using “a vast multimedia influence apparatus,” including bots, cyber-actors, fake news websites, and social media trolls. **Large language models (LLMs)** can now generate human-like tweets, comments, and articles at scale. Combined with deepfakes, doppelgänger sites, and AI-generated personas, these tools allow bad actors to craft propaganda that appears authentic, emotionally resonant, and difficult to detect.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "In this notebook, we’ll use machine learning — specifically, pretrained large language models — to study the language of disinformation in a real dataset of English and Russian-language tweets. These tweets include both propagandist and non-propagandist content.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Learning Outcomes\n",
        "By the end of this module, you will be able to better understand disinformation and propaganda techniques using the following computational tools:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Sentiment analysis** to detect emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral)\n",
        "- **Toxicity analysis** to identify harmful or aggressive language (e.g., insults, threats)\n",
        "- **Statistical testing** to compare patterns between tweet types and languages (e.g., English vs. Russian)\n",
        "\n",
        "You'll learn how to work with pretrained LLMs, interpret model predictions, and use basic statistical methods to answer questions like:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Are propagandist tweets more emotionally charged or toxic than normal political tweets?\n",
        "- Do they use different rhetorical strategies in different languages?\n",
        "- Can we identify signals that indicate a tweet is part of a disinformation campaign?\n",
        "\n",
        "Through this analysis, we’ll explore various dimmensions of AI applications, critically examining how it can be used to better understand and detect the patterns of disinformation when working with large amounts of social data.\n",
        "\n",
        "## Key Terms and Concepts\n",
        "\n",
        "**Disinformation:** Disinformation is generally understood as the *intentional* spreading of false, misleading, or incorrect information, in order to influence the public or create an outcome, usually political.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Propaganda:** Propaganda is similar to disinformation in it's intent to spread a cause or doctrine, but can differ in how systematically or overtly it is speread. The two concepts are both forms of misinformation, with propaganda generally being employed to promote a cause.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Large Language Model (LLM):** A Large Language Model is a langauge model trained on a very large set of text data, accessing the features of the text by converting units of text into quanitative representations that can be used for various tasks, such as chatbotting, or in the case of this notebook, Natural Language Processing.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Natural Langauge Processing encompasses a wide variety of techniques and practices wtih the goal of enabling computers to understand, interpret, and produce human language. The key NLP techniques in this notebook are *sentiment analysis*, a technique that analayzes the relative positivity or negativity of langauge, and *toxitcity analyis* which analyzes the relative aggressiveness of language.\n",
        "\n",
        "**BERT:** to enable these analyses we will be using two BERT models. BERT is an open-source framework for machine learning, whcih is used for NLP. BERT is well-suited to understanding langauge, rather than generating it, which is what this notebook is concerned with. The specific BERT models we are using are a multi-lingual [model](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2), which can analyze tweets in different languages, and a [model](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment) trained for analyzing tweet sentiments.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Fine Tuning:** The multi-lingual model is fine-tuned, or trained specifically on the Russian Disinformation tweet dataset. This is done by inputting a training subset of the data, where the tweets are labeled as Disinformation, into the BERT model to create a model familiar with our data, and well-suited to producing analyses.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "## Dataset\n",
        "\n",
        "Our data for this notebook comes from four sources:\n",
        "\n",
        "### 1) The analysis data: \n",
        "The data used from our analysis is a combination of four datasets: \n",
        "1) The Russian troll tweets dataset, AKA the Internet Research Agency (IRA) tweets dataset is a large, verified collection of social media posts created by the Internet Research agency, the Russian state-sponsored troll farm we talked about earlier. The data was collected and provided by FiveThirtyEight (RIP) an America political news website that focused on providing detailed statistical analyses of the political climate in the United States. Compared to other russian troll datasets, IRA dataset is unparalleled in terms of accuracy as because the data labels were directly provided by Twitter's internal security teams, which identified the IRA troll accounts and turned over to the United States Congress as evidence for the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence's investigation into foreign election interference. Hence, every single tweet in the dataset is a known, verified russian disinformation account. \n",
        "2) The sentiment140 dataset is a massive english language datasets of tweets, created by Standford with the purpose of training sentiment analysis detection models. This dataset serves as our english control group. \n",
        "3) Likewise, theRusentimental dataset is a dataset of modern-day Russian tweets, collected by Russian NLP researchers for sentiment analysis purposes. This serves as our Russian control group. \n",
        "4) Lastly, we added tweets taken from a collection of known russian disinformation accounts that were active during the start of the Russia-Ukraine War. Researchers selected these tweets based on the accounts' \"association with state-backed media and a history of spreading disinformation and misinformation\".\n",
        "\n",
        "### 2) The model training data:\n",
        "\n",
        "For our analysis, we trained a **tweet propaganda detection model** off of the paper \"Labeled Datasets for Research on Information Operations\", which provides the same verified collection of disinformation accounts from the IRA, as well as a \"control\" dataset of legitimate, topically-related accounts, which allowed for a direct, comparative analysis between malicious and organic online posts, within the same conversational political context. To avoid including training data in our in-class analysis, the IRA dataset was randomly split in two, with one half being used for model training and the other half being used for the in-class demo.\n",

        "\n",
        "In order to get started using machine learning to map disinformation campaigns, we need to set our machines up to be able to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Open and interpret the dataset.\n",
        "2. Visualize key aspects of the data.\n",
        "3. Access a pre-trained machine learning model that can be used on our data.\n",

        "To do this, we are using the `import` statement which allows us to access the functions and capabilities of each module. The modules we are using allow us to complete differenet tasks. We will use Python to do communicate which capabilities we want to use and we will continue writing in Python to use these capabilities.

        "As this definition alludes, sentiment analysis is a part of **natural language processing (NLP)**, a field at the intersection of human language and computation. Because humans are complex, emotional beings, the language we use is often shaped by our affective (emotional) dispositions. Sentiment analysis, sometimes referred to as “opinion mining”, is one way researchers can methodologically understand the emotional intentions, typically positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, that lie in textual datasets.\n",

        "> At the heart of sentiment analysis is the assumption that language reveals interior, affective states, and that these states can be codified and generalized to broader populations. AI scholar Kate Crawford, in her book [Atlas of AI](https://katecrawford.net/atlas), explores how many assumptions found in contemporary sentiment research (i.e., that there are 7 universal emotions) are largely unsubstantiated notions that emerged from mid-20th century research funded by the US Department of Defense. Rather than maintaining that emotions can be universally categorized, her work invites researchers to think about how emotional expression is highly contextualized by social and cultural factors and the distinct subject positions of content makers.\n",
