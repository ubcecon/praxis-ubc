The China Biographical Database Abstract:  The China Biographical Database is a freely accessible relational database with biographical information about approximately 641,568 individuals as of August 2024, currently mainly from the 7th through 19th centuries. With both online and offline versions, the data is meant to be useful for statistical, social network, and spatial analysis as well as serving as a kind of biographical reference. The image below shows the spatial distribution of a cross dynastic subset of 190,000 people in CBDB by basic affiliations

```{python}
import sqlite3
import pandas as pd

db_path = r'C:\Users\alexr\OneDrive\Desktop\WORK\Summer2025\latest.db'

# Connect to the database
conn = sqlite3.connect(db_path)

# Replace 'person' with the actual table name you want to load
df = pd.read_sql_query("SELECT * FROM person", conn)

# Show the first few rows
print(df.head())

conn.close()
```
