        "\n",
        "#### Overview of Historical Background\n",
        "\n",
        "***The 1884 Chinese Regulation Act*** in British Columbia is widely regarded as one of the most notorious discriminatory provincial laws targeting Chinese immigration, it was challenged and ultimately declared unconstitutional in the 1885 case of ***R v. Wing Chong*** by the judge Henry Pering Pellew Crease. The Justice Crease found the legislation to be unconstitutional on economic grounds; infringing on federal authority over immigration, trade, commerce, treaty-making, and taxation. \n",
        "\n",
        "The central figure in the ruling, *Henry Pering Pellew Crease*, came from a wealthy English military family, and possessed a prestigious law background. \n",
        "\n",
        "* His social identity was above-all English, and this was made clear in his politics. \n",
        "* He viewed Canada not as a new society to be built, but as an extension of the british empire. \n",
        "* He displayed mistrust towards Canadians, referring to them as \"North American Chinamen\", afraid that they would \"rule the country and job its offices\" (Tina Loo).\n",
        "\n",
        "In previous years, students expressed interest Crease's opinion on the 1884 Chinese regulation act, given that the regulation act was strongly condemned and ultimately struck down by Crease. However, this seems at odds with Crease's position on Chinese immigrants.\n",
        "\n",
        "This raises an interesting question: **Did Judge Crease strike down the act because of genuine anti-racism concerns, or because he saw the Chinese immigrant labor force as a valuable asset for growing the Canadian economy?**\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Objective\n",
        "\n",
        "* We aim to explore this question by analyzing the language used by Justice Crease in his legal opinions and writings related to Chinese immigrants through **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** approaches. By examining the text, we hope to uncover insights into his stance.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The workshop is also to demonstrate how historians can use computational tools to *help* them answer such a research question, by showing each step in the research process.\n",
        "\n",
        "* In the end, we will be able to transform the text documents into something more intuitive and visually appealing, such as a 2D UMAP projection of the legal text embeddings by sentences. This can possibly help historians to better interpret the relationship between different texts.\n",
        "\n",
        "![The 2D UMAP projection of legal text embeddings by sentences](data/embedding_visualization.png)\n",
        "\n",
        "#### The Problem: Legal Text Analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "Legal text analysis is itself a complex task, as legal documents are often lengthy, dense, formal, and filled with specialized terminology. They are also often written in neutral or passive voice, making it difficult to discern the author's personal opinions or biases, it poses unique challenges for historians and legal scholars alike, which also challenged the usual methods of natural language processing (NLP).\n",
        "\n",
        "Mining insights from such texts requires sophisticated techniques to extract meaningful information and identify patterns. We need the technique to be able to:\n",
        "* **Understand legal vocabulary**: Legal texts often contain specialized terminology and complex sentence structures, the technique should be able to handle legal jargon and formal language.\n",
        "* **Identify contextual semantics**: Legal texts often involve nuanced meanings and interpretations, so the technique should be able to capture the context and semantics of legal language.\n",
        "* **Handle ambiguity**: Legal texts can be ambiguous, with multiple interpretations possible, the technique should be able to handle ambiguity and provide insights into different interpretations.\n",
        "* **Extract relevant topics**: Legal texts often cover multiple topics and issues, the technique should be able to extract relevant topics and themes from the text.\n",
        "* **Analyze sentiment**: Legal texts can convey different sentiments, such as positive, negative, or neutral, the technique should be able to analyze sentiment and provide insights into the author's tone and attitude.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Research Approach\n",
        "\n",
        "In this workshop, we will explore how to address these challenges using a comparison approach, that is, while we focus on the text of Justice Crease, we will compare it with other legal texts from the same period to gain a better understanding of the language used in legal documents at that time.\n",
        "\n",
        "The first subject we will use for comparison is the ***1884 Chinese Regulation Act***, which was the law that Crease struck down. The second subject we will use for comparison is **Justice Matthew Baillie Begbie**, who testified alongside Crease in the 1884 Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Unlike Crease, historical accounts describe Begbie as protective of marginalized peoples, particularly Indigenous communities and Chinese immigrants.\n",
        "* Similar to what Crease did to the Chinese Regulation Act, Begbie struck down discriminatory municipal by-laws in Victoria that targeted Chinese-owned businesses in the 1888 case of ***R v. Victoria***.\n",
        "\n",
        "We use machine learning techniques, specifically text embeddings, to do the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Compile **a corpus of legal cases and commission reports** authored by contemporary judges concerning Chinese immigrants.\n",
        "2. Apply **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** to the reports in order to convert them to a machine-readable format. \n",
        "3. Examine **keywords** in the texts, to compare the positions of different justices and regulations.\n",
        "4. Use **machine learning** to assess the relative emphasis on economic versus social justice concerns.\n",
        "5. Use **sentiment analysis** to evaluate the tone of the documents, focusing on whether they reflect positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, and compare the sentiments of writings by different authors to identify patterns.\n",
        "6. Use **zero-shot classification** to evaluate whether the documents reflect pro-discrimination, neutral, or anti-discrimination positions.\n",
        "\n",
        "This approach demonstrates different techniques historians can use to identify patterns in documents for analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Data Collection and Preprocessing\n",
        "\n",
        "We plan to use 10 digitalized texts, they are:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Legal Documents that address Chinese immigration in BC during the period: \n",
        "    - *R v. Wing Chong* \n",
        "    - *Wong Hoy Woon v. Duncan* \n",
        "    - *R v. Mee Wah, R v. Victoria* \n",
        "    - *Chinese Regulation Act, 1884*\n",
        "- Reports authored by Crease and Begbie for the Royal Commission that show the judges' personal perspectives. \n",
        "- The remaining documents enrich our corpus for analysis and supplement our study.\n",
        "\n",
        "A big issue with working with historical texts is the format they're stored in: usually scans of varying quality from physical books, articles, etc. However, these are not machine-readable file formats (e.g., text files), so our first step will be using **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** to convert the scanned images into machine-readable text. We chose this approach because: \n",
        "\n",
        "1. It is a common technique for digitizing printed texts that is already widely used in legal case archives such as the CanLii database, and \n",
        "2. There are many OCR tools available that vary in cost, effectiveness, and ease of use. \n",
        "\n",
        "Below is a brief overview of early and modern OCR techniques:\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Early OCR (Pattern Matching):**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Compared each character image to a library of fonts and shapes.\n",
        "    - Worked well for clean, printed text.\n",
        "    - Struggled with handwriting, unusual fonts, or degraded scans.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Modern OCR (Intelligent Recognition):**\n",
        "\n",
        "    - Uses AI to \"read\" text more like a human.\n",
        "    - Analyzes shapes, context, and layout.\n",
        "    - Handles messy, handwritten, or complex documents much better.\n",
        "\n",
        "After testing several tools, we found that modern, AI-based OCR methods produced the most accurate results for our historical documents.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Data Overview\n",
        "\n",
        "After OCR, we obtained a `.csv` file containing the text and metadata of the documents. Note that we removed the direct quotes of the *1884 Chinese Regulation Act* in Crease's ruling, as they don't reflect his own language. The structure of the data is as follows:\n",

        "### How Computers Interpret Text?\n",
        "\n",
        "While computers can process text swiftly, they do not \"understand\" it in the human sense. Instead, they build mathematical models of language from statistical patterns and structural regularities. These models produce symbolic and continuous representations of words and passages that allow downstream algorithms to detect topics, relationships, and affective signals. However, these representations remain proxies for meaning rather than literal comprehension.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process typically involves a sequence of steps:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Tokenization**: Breaking text into analyzable units (words, subwords, or sentences). \n",
        "2. **Preprocessing**: Cleaning and normalizing text (lowercasing, removing OCR noise, handling archaic spelling). \n",
        "3. **Vectorization**: Converting tokens or texts into numerical vectors. \n",
        "\n",
        "    - Simple count-based approaches (TF-IDF) capture term importance across documents. \n",
        "    - Modern contextual methods (BERT, Legal‑BERT) produce dense embeddings that capture usage-dependent semantics.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Modeling and Comparison**: Applying algorithms to those vectors. Examples include cosine similarity for semantic closeness, UMAP for visualization, and zero‑shot classification.\n",
        "5. **Aggregation and Interpretation**: Aggregating sentence- or snippet-level outputs to produce document- or author-level summaries (mean stance vectors, topic distributions), followed by careful human interpretation.\n",
        "\n",
        "Why this is helpful for social science and humanities research:\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Scalability**: Enables analysis of large corpora beyond human reading capacity.\n",
        "- **Pattern Discovery**: Uncovers latent structures and relationships not easily seen by humans.\n",
        "- **Quantification**: Provides numerical measures of abstract concepts (e.g., sentiment, stance).\n",
        "- **Reproducibility**: Offers systematic, repeatable methods for text analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Count Approach: TF-IDF\n",
        "\n",
        "The **Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF)** is a statistical measure that evaluates the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents (corpus). It is one of the earliest and most widely used methods for text analysis. It is essentially a count-based approach that quantifies the importance of words in a document based on their frequency and distribution across multiple documents. TF-IDF works by calculating two components:\n",
        "1. **Term Frequency (TF)**: Measures how frequently a term appears in a document.\n",
        "2. **Inverse Document Frequency (IDF)**: Measures how important a term is across the entire corpus, by considering how many documents contain the term.\n",
        "\n",
        "For our purpose, we can use TF-IDF to identify the most important words in each document, which can help us understand the key themes and topics discussed in the text. More details on what we are going to do:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Regroup the text data into 5 groups:\n",
        "    - All writings\n",
        "    - Crease's writings\n",
        "    - Begbie's writings\n",
        "    - Chinese Regulation Act\n",
        "    - Other documents\n",
        "2. For each group, we will: \n",
        "    - Create a TF-IDF vectorizer to convert the text into numerical vectors.\n",
        "    - Remove common filler words (\"the\", \"and\", etc.).\n",
        "    - Calculate the TF-IDF scores for each word in the documents.\n",
        "    - Identify the most important words based on their TF-IDF scores.\n",

It also does not consider the context in which words are used, which can lead to misinterpretation of their meaning.\n",

        "With the advancement of machine learning, **text embeddings** emerged as a more powerful technique for text analysis. It represents words or phrases as dense vectors in a high-dimensional space, capturing semantic relationships between them. This allows for more nuanced understanding of text, enabling tasks like similarity measurement, clustering, and classification.\n",

        "There are several popular text embedding models, including:\n",
        "- **Word2Vec**: A neural network-based model that learns word embeddings by predicting context words given a target word (or vice versa).\n",
        "- **GloVe**: A global vector representation model that learns word embeddings by factorizing the word co-occurrence matrix.\n",
        "- **FastText**: An extension of Word2Vec that represents words as bags of character n-grams, allowing it to handle out-of-vocabulary words and capture subword information.\n",
        "- **BERT**: A transformer-based model that generates contextualized embeddings by considering the entire sentence context, allowing it to capture word meanings based on their surrounding words.\n",
        "\n",

[nlpaueb/legal-bert-base-uncased](https://huggingface.co/nlpaueb/legal-bert-base-uncased) is a BERT model pre-trained on English legal texts, including legislation, law cases, and contracts. It is designed to capture the legal language and semantics, making it suitable for our analysis. \n",

        "- Tokenize sentences into smaller subword units using a tokenizer.\n",

        "- Return a dictionary mapping each word to its mean embedding, capturing its semantic meaning in the context of the text.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this way, we are not only able to generate word embeddings with contextual meanings over the whole corpus, but also be able to aggregate our corpus into different groups, and generate contextualized word embeddings for each group."

        "1. Tokenize the text into smaller units and identify the positions of specific keywords or phrases that are relevant to the stance being analyzed.\n",

        "In the TF-IDF analysis, we observed that the word \"Chinese\" was a prominent term across all groups, indicating its centrality to the discussions in all texts. Following the word \"Chinese\", we also noticed that \"labor\", \"white\", \"legislation\", and \"taxation\" were all significant terms reflected in all texts.

It involves analyzing the words and phrases in the text to identify patterns and themes that can be grouped together into topics. Oftentimes, topic modeling are performed using unsupervised learning algorithms such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA). However, these methods may not be suitable for our corpus, as they require a large amount of text data and may not capture the nuances of legal language.\n",

        "\n",
        "Another powerful technique for text analysis is **zero-shot classification**, which allows us to classify text into predefined categories without requiring labeled training data, with the help of large language models (LLMs). This approach is particularly useful when we have a limited amount of labeled data or when the categories are not well-defined.\n",
        "\n",
        "In addition to classifying text into specific categories, zero-shot classification can also be used to evaluate the stance of a text towards a particular issue or topic by **calculating the probability of the text belonging to each category**, the calculated probabilities will sum to 1 and they can be interpreted as the model's confidence in each category. In this workshop, we mainly focus on the second aspect, which allows us to assess the stance of each text. \n",
        "\n",
        "We will use the Hugging Face Transformers library to implement zero-shot classification using a pre-trained model **facebook/bart-large-mnli**. The model is trained on the Multi-Genre Natural Language Inference (MultiNLI) dataset, which contains pairs of sentences labeled with their relationship (pros, cons, or neutral). This allows the model to learn how to classify text based on its semantic meaning and context, which is particularly useful for our analysis of historical texts.\n",
        "\n",
        "The key steps in our zero-shot classification process are as follows:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Define the zero-shot pipeline**: We create a zero-shot classification pipeline using the pre-trained model and tokenizer from Hugging Face Transformers, and specify a hypothesis template \"In this snippet of a historical legal text, the author {}\" that will be used to generate hypotheses for classification.\n",
        "2. **Define the candidate labels**: We define a set of candidate labels that represent the stance categories we want to classify the text into, which correspond to the basic stance categories we are interested in, such as \"pro\", \"neutral\" or \"cons\" the equal rights of Chinese immigrants.\n",
        "3. **Classify the text**: We apply the zero-shot classification pipeline to each text in our corpus, generating a probability distribution over the candidate labels for each text.\n",
        "4. **Investigate the results**: We analyze the classification results to identify the stance of each text, focusing on the highest probability label for each text. We also calculate the average probability for each candidate label across all texts to compare the overall stance of different authors and documents."

        "### Conclusion\n",
        "\n",
        "In this workshop, we explored how to effectively digitalize aged text document, as well as how to use various computational techniques to analyze historical legal texts, focusing on the stance of different authors towards Chinese immigrants in British Columbia. We applied a range of methods, including TF-IDF analysis, word embeddings, stance embeddings, zero-shot classification, and topic modeling, to gain insights into the language used in these texts and the positions expressed by different authors. \n",
        "\n",
        "The results of our analysis matched the expectations based on previous historical research, confirming that Crease and Begbie indeed held similar positions on the issue, while the Chinese Regulation Act reflected a more discriminatory stance (with higher \"Cons\" scores overall). In addition, we found interesting clustering patterns in the UMAP projection of the stance embeddings, which poses further questions for investigation, such as what each UMAP cluster represents and what each axis in the UMAP projection means. We also identified several key topics that were prominent in the texts, and explored how these topics relate to the stances expressed in the texts using zero-shot classification scores and topic alignment scores.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, we must note that these techniques are not perfect and have limitations, as the pre-trained models may contain biases and may not accurately capture the nuances of historical legal language. We also noted that the topic alignment scores and zero-shot classification scores are not deterministic, as they depend on the specific language used in defining the candidate labels and the context in which the text is used. Therefore, it is essential to interpret the results with caution and consider the limitations of the models used. Machine learning techniques should be used as auxiliary tools in research, and human interpretation and analysis are still crucial for understanding the positions expressed in historical texts.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, this workshop displayed a new perspective on how we can quantitatively analyze classical historical materials, but it also highlighted the limitations of these techniques and the importance of human interpretation in understanding the positions expressed in historical texts. We hope that this workshop has provided you with valuable insights into how computational techniques can be used to analyze historical legal texts, and how they can complement traditional research methods in the humanities and social sciences.\n",
