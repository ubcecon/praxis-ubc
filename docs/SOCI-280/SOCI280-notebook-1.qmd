## Disinformation in the Information Age

Disinformation is not new, but with the rise of digital platforms and generative AI, its scale, speed, and sophistication have grown exponentially. From elections and pandemics to social justice movements and international conflicts, false or misleading content is being spread online to manipulate emotions and polarize public opinion.

The challenge today is not just the volume of disinformation, but how convincing and targeted it has become. Former U.S. Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines describes how state-sponsored campaigns, like Russia‚Äôs Kremlin, now operate using ‚Äúa vast multimedia influence apparatus,‚Äù including bots, cyber-actors, fake news websites, and social media trolls. **Large language models (LLMs)** can now generate human-like tweets, comments, and articles at scale. Combined with deepfakes, doppelg√§nger sites, and AI-generated personas, these tools allow bad actors to craft propaganda that appears authentic, emotionally resonant, and difficult to detect.

In this notebook, we‚Äôll use machine learning ‚Äî specifically, pretrained large language models ‚Äî to study the language of disinformation in a real dataset of English and Russian-language tweets. These tweets include both propagandist and non-propagandist content.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, you will be able to better understand disinformation and propaganda techniques using the following computational tools:

- **Sentiment analysis** to detect emotional tone (positive, negative, neutral)
- **Toxicity analysis** to identify harmful or aggressive language (e.g., insults, threats)
- **Statistical testing** to compare patterns between tweet types and languages (e.g., English vs. Russian)

You'll learn how to work with pretrained LLMs, interpret model predictions, and use basic statistical methods to answer questions like:

- Are propagandist tweets more emotionally charged or toxic than others?
- Do they use different rhetorical strategies in different languages?
- Can we identify signals that indicate a tweet is part of a disinformation campaign?

Through this analysis, we‚Äôll explore various dimmensions of AI applications, critically examining how it can be used to better understand and detect the patterns of disinformation when working with large amounts of social data.

## Key Terms and Concepts

**Disinformation:** Disinformation is generally understood as the *intentional* spreading of false, misleading, or incorrect information, in order to influence the public or create an outcome, usually political.

**Propaganda:** Propaganda is similar to disinformation in it's intent to spread a cause or doctrine, but can differ in how systematically or overtly it is speread. The two concepts are both forms of misinformation, with propaganda generally being employed to promote a cause.

**Large Language Model (LLM):** A Large Language Model is a langauge model trained on a very large set of text data, accessing the features of the text by converting units of text into quanitative representations that can be used for various tasks, such as chatbotting, or in the case of this notebook, Natural Language Processing.

**Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Natural Langauge Processing encompasses a wide variety of techniques and practices wtih the goal of enabling computers to understand, interpret, and produce human language. The key NLP techniques in this notebook are *sentiment analysis*, a technique that analayzes the relative positivity or negativity of langauge, and *toxitcity analyis* which analyzes the relative aggressiveness of language.

**BERT:** to enable these analyses we will be using two BERT models. BERT is an open-source framework for machine learning, whcih is used for NLP. BERT is well-suited to understanding langauge, rather than generating it, which is what this notebook is concerned with. The specific BERT models we are using are a multi-lingual [model](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/paraphrase-multilingual-MiniLM-L12-v2), which can analyze tweets in different languages, and a [model](https://huggingface.co/cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment) trained for analyzing tweet sentiments.

**Fine Tuning:** The multi-lingual model is fine-tuned, or trained specifically on the Russian Disinformation tweet dataset. This is done by inputting a training subset of the data, where the tweets are labeled as Disinformation, into the BERT model to create a model familiar with our data, and well-suited to producing analyses.


# 0. Preliminary data analysis 

In order to get started using machine learning to map disinformation campaigns, we need to set our machines up to be able to:

1. Open and interpret the dataset.
2. Visualize key aspects of the data.
3. Access a pre-trained machine learning model that can be used on our data.

To do this, we are using the `import` statement which allows us to access the functions and capabilities of each module. The modules we are using allow us to complete differenet tasks. We are using a coding language called Python to do communicate which capabilities we want to use and we will continue writing in Python to use these capabilities. It is what we are using to communicate what libraries or capabilities we want to use. We will learn more about what each module is doing as we continue to use them.

Now that we have successfully accessed all of the functions we need to carry out our disinformation investigation, we can start to look into the data we are working with. We are going to be using the `pandas` library, which is a popular tool to read and handle data. The block of code below will first load in the dataset named `russian_disinformation_tweets.csv` and then, based on the information contained in the file, it will `print` the specified information. In this case we are looking at three different features of our data:

1. The names of the columns in our dataset
2. The number of tweets not labeled as control i.e. russian disinformation
3. The number of tweets labeled as control i.e. *not* russian disinformation

The code below also does a little bit of housekeeping, by using the function `tweets.rename` to change the column names from `post text` and `is_control` to `text` and `labels` respectively.

Now, take a look a the output of this block and identify the number of disinformation tweets found in the data. How many non-disinformation tweets are in the data? 

üí° **Hint:** Python outputs the results of the code in the order it is written!

```{python}
tweets = pd.read_csv("soci_270/russian_disinformation_tweets.csv")

print(tweets.columns)
print(len(tweets[tweets["is_control"] == False]))
print(len(tweets[tweets["is_control"] == True]))
tweets = tweets.rename(columns={"post_text": "text", "is_control": "labels"})
```

To continue exploring the data, we are going to take a look at tweets that are labeled as control tweets, meaning they are not Russian disinformation. These tweets just come from regular users posts. These posts are not necessarily apolitical, or without an attempt to persuade, however, they do not meet the dataset criteria of disinformation. 

Take a look at a few of the characteristics of the tweets below, looking at both the text of the tweets and the data associated with each post. Some of the tweets look very similar to each other. Look through the tweet metadata and examine if any of the other characteristics of the posts are similar. 

Think about what you might be able to infer from each user based on their posts, and the metadata avaialable to us in this dataset. Consider what is missing from this picture as well. What data might be unavailable to us, and how does it limit our picture of these users. While you are building a picture of the twitter user (their beliefs, intent, history, posting time, etc...) come up with a few reasons why these users were not labeled as disinformation. 

```{python}
print(tweets[tweets["labels"] == True])
```


Now that we know a little bit about the data and our users, we are going to continue doing some housekeeping by converting the post time and date from characters to into dates that are able to be interpreted by the computer and used for analysis. Additionally, we'll create a follower/following ratio to add another dimension to our data. 

We can then use this information to visualize the posting activity of the disinformation bots and the control tweets. In our visualization, the label `True` corresponds to tweets that are part of the control group and the label `False` corresponds to tweets containing disinformation. 

There are meany ways the posting activity could be represented visually. In this graph we are representing the posting activity by the week over the course of a decade. It is important to select a scale which is appropriate for the amount of data we are working with, especially if that data spans a wide range. Here we are using a log scale on the y-axis (the number of posts) 

> A Log (or logarithmic) scale is a way to represent data which spans large numerical ranges, and makes it easier to visualize and interpret data that changes dramatically. 

As you look at the graph pay close attention to the following:

1. General trends in activity. Does either type of tweet increase over time? Is there any stagnation? Which years had the most weekly overall activity?

2. Which years stick out as being exceptionally different. Consider some key events from those years. If nothing comes to mind immediately, do a quick search for top news topics of those years in your browser.

```{python}
tweets['post_time'] = pd.to_datetime(tweets['post_time'], errors='coerce')
tweets['post_date'] = tweets['post_time'].dt.date
tweets['post_hour'] = tweets['post_time'].dt.hour  
tweets['week'] = tweets['post_time'].dt.to_period('W').apply(lambda r: r.start_time) 
tweets['follow_ratio'] = tweets['follower_count'] / (tweets['following_count'].replace(0, 1))   # follower/following ratio
```

```{python}
tweets['account_type'] = tweets['labels'].map({True: 'Control', False: 'IO'})
```

```{python}

weekly_counts = tweets.groupby(['week', 'labels']).size().reset_index(name='count')

plt.figure(figsize=(12, 5))
sns.lineplot(data=weekly_counts, x='week', y='count', hue='labels')

plt.yscale('log')
plt.title("Weekly Posting Activity (Disinformation vs Control)")
plt.xlabel("Week")
plt.ylabel("Number of Posts (log scale)")
plt.legend(title="Label")
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

Another dimmension we could look at with this data is the posting activity of Control vs. Disinformation tweets over the course of the day. Here we are going to define a function that will allow us to visualize the average number of posts across the course of a day, starting with Hour 0 until Hour 24. Take a look at the widgets below and play around with the dates to see how the tweet volume changes. 


üß† **Key Questions:** 

- Consider why each account is posting at different times.
- Is there a meaningingful difference in who posts when? Why might that be?
- Is there anything surprising to you about the tweet volume at each hour? 

Think about some possible explanations for the trends in the data and consider whether it confirms or challenges your assumptions about how  and when disinformation is produced.

```{python}

import ipywidgets as widgets
from IPython.display import display, clear_output

start_date_widget = widgets.DatePicker(value=min(tweets['post_date']), description='Start Date')
end_date_widget = widgets.DatePicker(value=max(tweets['post_date']), description='End Date')

output = widgets.Output()

def update_time_series(change=None):
    with output:
        clear_output(wait=True)
        start = start_date_widget.value
        end = end_date_widget.value
        mask = (tweets['post_date'] >= start) & (tweets['post_date'] <= end)
        data_range = tweets[mask].groupby(['post_date','account_type']).size().reset_index(name='post_count')
        data_pivot = data_range.pivot(index='post_date', columns='account_type', values='post_count').fillna(0)
        # Plot
        plt.figure(figsize=(8,4))
        for acct_type, col in [('IO','orange'), ('Control','blue')]:
            if acct_type in data_pivot:
                plt.plot(data_pivot.index, data_pivot[acct_type], label=acct_type, color=col)
        plt.legend(); plt.xlabel('Date'); plt.ylabel('Posts')
        plt.title(f'Post Volume ({start} to {end})')
        plt.tight_layout()
        plt.show()

# Attach the update function to widget changes
start_date_widget.observe(update_time_series, names='value')
end_date_widget.observe(update_time_series, names='value')

# Display widgets and initial plot
display(widgets.HBox([start_date_widget, end_date_widget]))
update_time_series()
display(output)
```

The following graph represents the average posting activity over the course of a day by each type of account (Regular and Disinformation). 

>‚è™ **Callback**
>
>Remember when we first examined the features of our data, the total number of disinformation posts was significantly higher than the number of control posts. That difference in volume is represented graphically below with the greater average number of posts from disinformation accounts. It is important to recognize that this is just a feature of our dataset, and is not necessarily representative of all the posts on Twitter at that time. Nevertheless, there are some important features of this visualization that we need to consider. 

As you look over the graph, try to answer the following questions:

1. Why are disinformation accounts posting early in the morning and late at night? What might they be trying to acheive with such an aggressive posting schedule.
2. Think about your own social media posting. When do you usually post? Is this reflected by the Control curve?
3. Additionally, think about when you are on social media. What hours are you most frequently looking at content? 

>üì± **Activity**
>
>If you freuqently use social media, take a look at you screen activity in your devices settings and look at the hours you frequently use social media applications. If you don't have social media, find a partner who's comfortable sharing their data with you and compare the hours of usage to the posting activity of the Disinformation accounts and the Control accounts. 
>

Does your usage align or differ from the activity of the accounts in our dataset?

```{python}

posts_by_hour = tweets.groupby(['post_hour','account_type']).size().reset_index(name='count')
hour_pivot = posts_by_hour.pivot(index='post_hour', columns='account_type', values='count').fillna(0)

plt.figure(figsize=(8,4))
sns.lineplot(x=hour_pivot.index, y=hour_pivot['IO'], label='IO', color='orange')
sns.lineplot(x=hour_pivot.index, y=hour_pivot['Control'], label='Control', color='blue')
plt.title('Average Posting Activity by Hour of Day')
plt.xlabel('Hour of Day'); plt.ylabel('Average # of Posts')
plt.xticks(range(0,24,3))
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

Below, we examine the breakdown of tweets by account type and language by subsetting our data. We are going to view the top 10 languages in our dataset with the following code which groups the data into the two catagories language and account type.

```{python}
lang_counts = tweets.groupby(['post_language','account_type']).size().reset_index(name='count')
lang_pivot = lang_counts.pivot(index='post_language', columns='account_type', values='count').fillna(0)
lang_pivot['Total'] = lang_pivot.sum(axis=1)
lang_pivot = lang_pivot.sort_values('Total', ascending=False)

display(lang_pivot.head(10)) 
```

**First,** Lets identify the top 10 langauges in our data

English, Undetermined, Russian, French, Spanish, Arabic, Portugese, UNKNOWN, Turksih, Italian


**Second,** for each langauge, we'll determine which account is posting more frequently.


>**English:** Disinforamtion
>
>**Undetermined:** Disinformation
>
>**Russian:** Control
>
>**Frech:** Disinformation
>
>**Spanish:** Control
>
>**Arabic:** Disinformation
>
>**Portugese:** Control
>
>**(UNKNOWN):** Disinformation
>
>**Turkish:** Disinformation
>
>**Italian:** Control

From this list we can see there are only four langauges which have more Control posts than disinformation posts. As we know, there are more disinformation posts in the dataset, so this is not necessarily surprising. One thing we can do to make this data more meaningul is to examine the ratio of control to disinformation tweets. This will help us determine where disinformation efforts are being focused linguistically.

>**English:** .07
>
>**Undetermined:** .03
>
>**Russian:** 2.18
>
>**Frech:** .62
>
>**Spanish:** 2.99
>
>**Arabic:** .40
>
>**Portugese:** 4.55
>
>**(UNKNOWN):** .40
>
>**Turkish:** .45
>
>**Italian:** 1.86

From here we can see that excluding unknown languges the language with the lowest ratio (most disinformation) is very clearly English. As it appears rusian propagandists and disinformation agents are least concerned with Russia and Spain, and most aggressively target English information markets.

## 0.1 Hashtag analysis

The next step in our data analysis is going to explore the most frequent hashtags from each account type. The code below finds the 10 most frequent hashtags from the control accounts and the disinformation accounts and displays them with their frequency. As you look at the tables below, pay attention to the content and the language of the hashtags. 

From our langauge analysis we can reasonable predict disinformation is likely to be in the English language, but the components of langauge that are frequently being used can be found by looking at the hashtags coming from these accounts. 

üß† **Key Questions**

1. With reference to the timeline of tweets, and the hashtags below, describe some of the main targets of Russian disinformation. 
2. Given what you know about disinformation, what are the *intentions* of these accounts, and what *outcomes* are they attempting to create?
3. What do the hashtags *not* tell us about the disinformation accounts? Where might our ability to conclude the intentions and outcomes of these accounts be limited by the data we have examined?
4. What additional data could we collect to better understand this type of disinformation. 

```{python}

tweets_hs = tweets.explode('hashtags').rename(columns={'hashtags': 'hashtag'})

tweets_hs = tweets_hs[tweets_hs['hashtag'].notna() & (tweets_hs['hashtag'] != '')]
tweets_hs['hashtag'] = tweets_hs['hashtag'].str.lower()

top_io = (
    tweets_hs[tweets_hs['account_type'] == 'IO']
    .groupby('hashtag').size()
    .nlargest(10)
    .reset_index(name='count')
)

top_control = (
    tweets_hs[tweets_hs['account_type'] == 'Control']
    .groupby('hashtag').size()
    .nlargest(10)
    .reset_index(name='count')
)

print("Top 10 Hashtags - IO Accounts")
display(top_io)

print("\nTop 10 Hashtags - Control Accounts")
display(top_control)
```

### üõë Stop and Reflect ###

Now that we have gone through the dataset and examined a variety of its features, take a few minutes and disucss the following questions with a partner or small group. 

1. What are the conclusions we have come to regarding disinformation? How are they influenced or limited by the dataset? 
2. So far we have only looked at statistical aspects of the data without using machine learning techniques. Make some predictions on how the machine learning techniques we will use next might change our understanding of online disinformation. How might machine learning, specifically NLP be used to enrich our understanding of disinformation?
3. Has your understanding of online disinformation changed after looking at this data? Write down a few questions you have about online disinformation, the dataset, or the computational methods we have been using.

## 1. Can we tune models to detect online disinformation campaigns? Classifying current tweets with a model finetuned on the russian_disinformation_tweets dataset

### Exploring Our Model

Now that we have examined our data and looked at some of the key features in the Russian Disinformation Dataset, we can start thinking about ways to use machine learning to answer questions, classify features, and make predictions about our dataset. To do any of these tasks we first require a way to interpret the text data and assign numeric qualities to our tweets. 

The model we are using to do this is a multilingual model which maps sentences and paragraphs into multi-dimensional vector space. In other words, it takes the sentences and paragraphs of our tweets and assigns them a position associated with their meaning. This is done based on the context of the token (the unit of text, like a word or sentence). The model we are using is capable of interpreting multiple languages and is fine-tuned, or specifically trained, on the data we are examining. The code below is going to call upon a pre-built classifier which uses this fine-tuned model to predict whether a tweet is likely Russian propaganda. The two sample tweets are: 

1. ‚Äú#qanon #trump Hunter Biden is a Ukranian Shill‚Äù 

2. ‚ÄúWhat great weather we have today‚Äù 

The model is going to take these text inputs, represent them in vector space, and then report whether their respective values are similar to those of disinformation tweets.  

### Classification and It's Discontents ### 

Before we explore the possibilities of our model to classify, we should first consider some of the main concerns and limitations regarding classification. Classification is an essential element of how machine learning operates. At its core it is the method of finding features that are central to a class and assigning units to that class based on those features. As you may already see, this "in-or-out" framework necessarily flattens some of the richness of human life, in order to effectively create these incredibly useful classes.

> **Example:** 
>
> You might say a cat and a dog are really easy to classify. Most people know what a dog looks like and that it looks different than a cat. But if all I tell you is that there are two animals that commonly live with humans, that have a tail and paws, and make noise you might have a hard time classifying them, because they share common features.
>
> It is important to think deeply about how we are classifying, especially as many datasets are labeled by people, who carry their own understandings of what belongs to each class.
>
> Any class or classifier will be informed by the balance of abstraction to specificity, and we should always keep this in mind when we are classifying. It is important to be specific enough to ascertain the qualities we are interested in, but not so specific we end up with thousands of classes.

Now that we have explored some of the trickiness of classification as a concept, we can look at how machine learning can help us work through some of these challenges. By using data that is labeled as disinformation our model can be trained to associated certain numerical feautres with disinformation, and when we give it text data that is similar to what it knows to be disinformation, it will classify it as such.

```{python}
from inference_code.py import classify_texts

texts = ["#qanon #trump Hunter Biden is a ukrainian shill", "What great weather we have today"]
for text in texts:
    preds, probs = classify_texts([text])

    label_map = {0: "Control", 1: "IO"}  
    pred_label = label_map[preds[0]]
    pred_prob  = probs[0, preds[0]]

    print(f"Text: {text}")
    print(f"Predicted class: {pred_label}  (confidence: {pred_prob:.2f})")
```

## 1. What is Sentiment Analysis?
> ‚ÄúSentiment analysis is the practice of applying natural language processing and text analysis techniques to identify and extract subjective information from text‚Äù (Hussein, 2018). 

As this definition alludes, sentiment analysis is a part of **natural language processing (NLP)**, a field at the intersection of human language and computation. Because humans are complex, emotional beings, the language we use is often shaped by our affective (emotional) dispositions. Sentiment analysis, sometimes referred to as ‚Äúopinion mining‚Äù, is one way researchers can methodologically understand the emotional intentions, typically positive, negative, or neutral sentiments, that lie in textual datasets.

> ### üîé Engage Critically
> At the heart of sentiment analysis is the assumption that language reveals interior, affective states, and that these states can be codified and generalized to broader populations. AI scholar Kate Crawford, in her book [Atlas of AI](https://katecrawford.net/atlas), explores how many assumptions found in contemporary sentiment research (i.e., that there are 7 universal emotions) are largely unsubstantiated notions that emerged from mid-20th century research funded by the US Department of Defense. Rather than maintaining that emotions can be universally categorized, her work invites researchers to think about how emotional expression is highly contextualized by social and cultural factors and the distinct subject positions of content makers.
>
>> ‚ùì Consider the research question for your sentiment analysis. How might the text you are working with be shaped by the distinct groups that have generated it?
> 
>> ‚ùì Are there steps you can take to educate yourself around the unique language uses of your dataset (for example, directly speaking with someone from that group or learning from a qualified expert on the subject)?
> 
If you‚Äôre interested, you can learn more about data justice in community research in a [guide](https://orice.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/43/2022/06/2022-Gender-Guide-1.pdf) created by UBC‚Äôs Office for Regional and International Community Engagement.

The rise of [web 2.0](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web_2.0) has produced prolific volumes of user-generated content (UGC) on the internet, particularly as people engage in a variety of social platforms and forums to share opinions, ideas and express themselves. Maybe you are interested in understanding how people feel about a particular political candidate by examining tweets around election time, or you wonder what people think about a particular bus route on reddit. UGC is often unstructured data, meaning that it isn‚Äôt organized in a recognizable way.

Structured data for opinions about a political candidate might look like this:

| Pro      | Con | Neutral    |
| ----------- | ----------- | -----------
| Supports climate action policies      | No plan for lowering the cost of living       | UBC Graduate
| Expand mental health services   |        |

While unstructured data might look like this:

> love that she‚Äôs trying to increase mental health services  + actually cares abt the climate üëè but what's up w rent n grocieries?? i dont wanna go broke out here üò≠ a ubc alum too like i thought she'd understand

In the structured data example above, the reviewer defines which parts of the feedback are positive, negative or neutral. In the unstructured example on the other hand, there are many typos and a given sentence might include a positive and a negative review as well as more nuanced contextual information (i.e. mentioning being a UBC alum when discussing cost of living). While messy, this contextual information often carries valuable insights that can be very useful for researchers.

The task of sentiment analysis is to make sense of these kinds of nuanced textual data - often for the purpose of understanding people, predicting human behaviour, or even in some cases, manipulating human behaviour.

Disinformation campaigns often aim to sway public opinion by influencing the emotional tone of online conversations. **Sentiment analysis** allows us to detect and understand these patterns by identifying whether large volumes of text express **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral** sentiment.

Our model is pretrained, meaning it has already learnt from millions of labelled examples how to distinguish different sentiments. Specifically, because the model we‚Äôll be using was trained on English tweets, it‚Äôs tuned to the language and syntax common on Twitter/X, and is limited to analyzing English-language text.

**Language is complex and always changing.**

In the English language, for example, the word ‚Äúpresent‚Äù has multiple meanings which could have positive, negative or neutral connotations. Further, a contemporary sentiment lexicon might code the word ‚Äúmiss‚Äù as being associated with negative or sad emotional experiences such as longing; if such a lexicon were applied to a 19th century novel which uses the word ‚Äúmiss‚Äù to describe single women, then, it might incorrectly associate negative sentiment where it shouldn‚Äôt be. While sentiment analysis can be a useful tool, it demands ongoing criticality and reflexivity from a researcher (you!). Throughout your analysis, be sure to continually ask yourself whether a particular sentiment lexicon is appropriate for your project.

Now, we're ready to get back to our analysis. Below, we'll load in our model and tokenizer and start playing around with identifying the sentiment of different phrases. 

```{python}
from transformers import pipeline

local_dir = "../twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest"

sentiment = pipeline(
    "sentiment-analysis",
    model=local_dir,
    tokenizer=local_dir,
)

print(sentiment("I HATE JOE BIDEN"))
```

Let‚Äôs breakdown this output. There are two parts to what the model returns:

1. **Label** ‚Üí a classification labelling the text as either having positive, negative, or neutral sentiment 
2. **Score** ‚Üí the model‚Äôs confidence in it‚Äôs classification

        ax.set_title("Sentiment Probability Distribution")

### Batch Sentiment Analysis

Now, let‚Äôs start running sentiment analysis on our dataset. The general steps to run our analysis include: 

1. Loading a pretrained model and tokenizer
    
    We load a RoBERTa model that has been fine-tuned for sentiment analysis on tweets, along with its corresponding tokenizer.
    
2. Creating sentiment analysis pipeline
    
    We set up a Hugging Face pipeline that handles finer steps in our sentiment analysis, such as **tokenization** (breaking up text into smaller units, called *tokens*), **batching** (processing multiple texts at once for efficiency), and **prediction** (predicting the overall sentiment). 
    
3. Running batch sentiment analysis on the dataset
    
    To efficiently analyze large numbers of tweets, we split the dataset into batches of 1,000 tweets and process them one batch at a time. To store the predictions, we extract the predicted sentiment labels and save them in a column named `sentiment`.

4. Previewing the results
    

```{python}
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification, pipeline

# Step 1
model_path = "../twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest"
tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
model = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_path)

tokenizer.model_max_length = tokenizer.model_max_length if tokenizer.model_max_length <= 512 else 512

# Step 2
sentiment_pipeline = pipeline(
    "sentiment-analysis",
    model=model,
    tokenizer=tokenizer,
    device=0,
    truncation=True,
    padding=True,
)

# Step 3
batch_size = 1000
for start in range(0, len(tweets_small), batch_size):
    end = start + batch_size
    batch_texts = tweets_small["text"].iloc[start:end].tolist()
    results = sentiment_pipeline(batch_texts)           
    labels  = [res["label"] for res in results]
    tweets_small.loc[start:end-1, "sentiment"] = labels 

# Step 4
print(tweets_small[["text", "sentiment"]].head())
```

We can see the first 5 tweets and their predicted sentiment above.

Now that we know how to run sentiment analysis to identify the overarching sentiment of a tweet, we are now in good position to ask and investigate whether emotionally charged language is more common in propaganda. Let‚Äôs explore this by forming a hypothesis and testing it statistically. 

> ### üîé Engage Critically
> **Hypothesis**: Propagandist tweets (`is_control == 1`) are more emotionally charged ‚Äî that is, they are more likely to be classified as **Positive** or **Negative** (non-neutral) compared to non-propagandist tweets (`is_control == 0`).
>
> We will test whether the difference in sentiment category frequencies between the two groups is statistically significant.

First, let‚Äôs examine the sentiment distribution for each group:

```{python}
dist = pd.crosstab(tweets_small['sentiment'], tweets_small['labels'], normalize='columns')
dist.columns = ['Non-propagandist', 'Propagandist']
print(dist * 100)
```

Reading the table, we can see that the majority of non-propagandist tweets are either negative (~43%) or neutral (~44%), while the majority of propagandist tweets (~63%) express neutral sentiment. 

```{python}
print(tweets_small['sentiment'])
```

```{python}
import numpy as np
from scipy.stats import chi2_contingency

# We define 'charged' sentiment as Positive or Negative
tweets_small['charged'] = tweets_small['sentiment'].isin(['positive', 'pegative']).astype(int)

# Constructing a  contingency table: rows = propagandist/non propagandist group, columnss = charged vs neutral
contingency = pd.crosstab(tweets_small['labels'], tweets_small['charged'])
print("Contingency table:\n", contingency)

# Chi-squared test
chi2, p, dof, expected = chi2_contingency(contingency)
print(f"p-value = {p:.3e}")
```

> ### üîé Engage Critically 
> Try interpreting the output. What are our results telling us? Based on the p-value, what can we conclude about our hypothesis?

## 3. Multilingual Sentiment Analysis
Our dataset of tweets (`russian_disinformation_tweets.csv`) isn‚Äôt entirely in English ‚Äî many of the tweets are written in Russian. Could this be skewing our results? How is our model actually handling Russian-language tweets compared to English ones?

> ### üîé Engage Critically 
> Recall our discussion on sentiment lexicons in Section 1:
>
>> While sentiment analysis can be a useful tool, it demands ongoing criticality and reflexivity from a researcher (you!). Throughout your analysis, be sure to continually ask yourself whether a particular sentiment lexicon is appropriate for your project.
> 
> ‚ùì How might the use of a monolingual sentiment model introduce bias into our results? Are non-English tweets being misclassified as neutral, negative, or positive when they shouldn‚Äôt be?

With this in mind, let‚Äôs explore below. We'll use the Unicode values of Cyrillic characters to identify Russian-language tweets, and run sentiment analysis seperately on Russiand and English tweets. 

```{python}

import re
tweets_lang = tweets_small.copy()

# Identify Russian-language tweets
tweets_lang['language'] = tweets_lang['text'].apply(
     lambda txt: 'ru' if re.search('[\u0400-\u04FF]', str(txt)) else 'en'
)

# Filter English and Russian tweets
eng_tweets = tweets_lang[tweets_lang['language'] == 'en']
ru_tweets  = tweets_lang[tweets_lang['language'] == 'ru']

# Sentiment distribution within each language group
eng_dist = pd.crosstab(eng_tweets['sentiment'], eng_tweets['labels'], normalize='columns') * 100
ru_dist  = pd.crosstab(ru_tweets['sentiment'],  ru_tweets['labels'],  normalize='columns') * 100
eng_dist.columns = ['Non-propagandist', 'Propagandist']
ru_dist.columns  = ['Non-propagandist', 'Propagandist']

print("English Tweets Sentiment (%):\n", eng_dist, "\n")
print("Russian Tweets Sentiment (%):\n", ru_dist)
```

> ### üîé Engage Critically 
> Take a moment to interpret the results before continuing. What do they tell us about the performance of our model on Russian-language tweets? Why do you think that is?

From the table above, we can see that our model is performing very poorly on Russian-language tweets, as nearly all of the Russian tweets are being marked as neutral regardless of if they are propagandist or not. This means that the pretrained model we were using before is not an appropriate choice based on the characteristics of our data, namely that a significant portion of the tweets are written in Russian, a language the model was not trained to make reliable predictions on. 

Let‚Äôs try re-running our sentiment analysis using a different model. This time, we‚Äôll use a model trained on 198 million tweets that were not filtered by language. As a result, the training data reflects the most commonly used languages on the platform at the time of collection, with Russian conveniently ranking as the 11th most frequent.

We'll follow the same steps for batch sentiment analysis that we did in Section 2:

```{python}
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSequenceClassification, pipeline
import tweetnlp

# Step 1: Load the pretrained multilingual model and tokenizer
model_path = "../twitter-xlm-roberta-base-sentiment-multilingual"
tokenizer_multi = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)
model_multi = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained(model_path)

tokenizer_multi.model_max_length = min(tokenizer_multi.model_max_length, 512)

# Step 2: Create the sentiment analysis pipeline
sentiment_multi_pipeline = pipeline(
    "sentiment-analysis",
    model=model_multi,           
    tokenizer=tokenizer_multi,   
    device=0,
    truncation=True,
    padding=True,
)

# Step 3: Run batch sentiment analysis
batch_size = 1000
for start in range(0, len(tweets_small), batch_size):
    end = start + batch_size
    batch_texts = tweets_small["text"].iloc[start:end].tolist()
    results = sentiment_multi_pipeline(batch_texts)           
    labels  = [res["label"] for res in results]
    tweets_small.loc[start:end-1, "sentiment"] = labels 

# Step 4: Preview results
print(tweets_small[["text", "sentiment"]].head())
```

To make the results easier to visualize, let's create a table that shows the percentage distribution of sentiment labels (positive, neutral, negative) within propagandist and non-propagandist tweets.

```{python}
multi_dist = pd.crosstab(tweets_small['sentiment'], tweets['labels'], normalize='columns') * 100
multi_dist.columns = ['Non-propagandist', 'Propagandist']
print("Multilingual Model Sentiment (%):\n", multi_dist)
```

The sentiment distribution between propagandist and non-propagandist tweets is quite similar when using the multilingual model. Both groups are predominantly neutral (around 50%), with roughly equal proportions of negative and positive sentiment. 

Now, let‚Äôs run a statistical test to see if there‚Äôs a meaningful difference in sentiment between propagandist and non-propagandist tweets. Specifically, we want to know: 

> *Are propagandist tweets more likely to be emotionally charged (positive or negative) than neutral, compared to non-propagandist tweets?*

To answer this, we‚Äôll use a **chi-squared test**, which helps us check whether the differences we see in the data are likely due to chance or if they‚Äôre statistically significant.

```{python}
tweets_small['charged_multi'] = tweets_small['sentiment'].isin(['positive','negative']).astype(int)
contingency_multi = pd.crosstab(tweets_small['labels'], tweets_small['charged_multi'])
chi2_multi, p_multi, *_ = chi2_contingency(contingency_multi)
print(f"Chi-squared p-value with multilingual model: {p_multi:.3e}")
```

> ### üîé Engage Critically 
> Take a moment to interpret the results before continuing. What does our p-value tell us about our inital research question above?

Our p-value (0.00003727) is much smaller than the common significance level of 0.05, indicating that the difference in how emotionally charged tweets are distributed between propagandist and non-propagandist groups is very unlikely to be due to random chance.

This means there is strong evidence that propagandist tweets are more likely to be emotionally charged compared to non-propagandist tweets, according to the multilingual model‚Äôs sentiment analysis.

## 4. Introduction to Toxicity Analysis
*Warning: this section contains examples of potentially offensive or profane text*

**Toxicity analysis** is another type of classification task that uses machine learning to detect whether a piece of text contains toxic speech. Jigsaw, a Google subsidary and leader in technological solutions for threats to civil society, uses the following definition for "toxic speech" proposed by Dixon et al. (2018):

> ‚Äù[R]ude, disrespectful, or unreasonable language that
is likely to make someone leave a discussion‚Äù

> ### üîé Engage Critically 
> This definition is widely considered by the NLP community to be ill-defined and vague. Why do you think? What issues could potentially arise from this definition, and how could they impact (for example) a comment flagging tool that gives warnings to social media users whose comments meet this definition of toxic speech?

A core issue defined by Berezin, Farahbakhsh, and Crespi (2023) is that the definition "gives no quantitative measure of the toxicity and operates with highly subjective cultural terms", yet still remains widely used by researchers and developers in the field. We'll explore some of the ways this definition is influencing toxicity analysis briefly below. 

### 4.1 Positive profanity

![Fuck dude, nurses are the shit (Mauboussin, 2022)](/soci_270_images/toxicity_noscore_reddit_example.png "Text: Fuck dude, nurses are the shit")

Consider the Reddit post above. Is the comment an example of toxic speech? Probably not, right? 

Now imagine you are Perspective API, Google's AI toxicity moderation tool, with your scope of "toxic speech" limited solely to the definition of ‚Äùrude, disrespectful, or unreasonable language that is likely to make someone leave a discussion‚Äù. Because of your architecture, you are limited in the way you can understand a message in context. You process the comment and immediately detect two profanities that meet your requirement for being rude language, and assign it a subsequent toxicity score:

![Fuck dude, nurses are the shit with Toxicity Score (98.62%) (Mauboussin, 2022)](/soci_270_images/toxicity_reddit_example.png "Fuck dude, nurses are the shit with Toxicity Score (98.62%)")

This is where, in the NLP community, there has been a growing discussion to ensure toxicity analysis tools, especially detectors used in online discussion and social media platforms, are more robust than simply being 'profanity detectors'. They must be able to interpret a word in context. 

### 4.2 In-group language

Consider in-group words used by distinct communities. Many of these words, once used as derogatory slurs against a group of people (such as Black or LGBTQ+ folk), have now largely been reclaimed and are prevalent in the lexicons of individuals identifying within these communities, no longer considered offensive when used by the in-group. However, if human annotators label textual data that ML models then are trained on, biases can permeate the models and lead to the classification of non-toxic, in-group language as harmful or offensive. Notably, African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) has been found to be flagged as toxic due to linguistic bias. XX frames how the challenge impacts toxicity detectors well:

> ### üîé Engage Critically 
> How do you think this challenge can impact toxicity detectors? Resende et al. (2024) underscore this tension, noting that:
>
>> ...[S]uch a fine line between causal speaking and offensive discourse is problematic from a human and computational perspective. In that case, these interpretations are confounding to automatic content moderation tools. In other words, toxicity/sentiment analysis tools are usually developed using manual rules or supervised ML techniques that employ human-labeled data to extract patterns. The disparate treatment embodied by machine learning
models usually replicates discrimination patterns historically practiced by humans when interacting with processes in the real world. Due to biases in this process, a lack of context leads both rule-based and machine learning-based models to a concerning scenario where minorities do not receive equal treatment. 
> <br> *Resende et al., 2024, p. 2*

Resende et al. (2024) also conducted a comparison analysis of toxicity models, including Google's Perspective API and Detoxify (the model we'll be using for our own analysis soon). 

![Comparing the Toxicity Scoring Models (Resende et al., 2024)](/soci_270_images/toxicity_aave_score_table.png "Comparing the Toxicity Scoring Models")

This bias shown in this model's performance can come from many factors in its structure, from data provenance and annotation to model architecture and processing, to a combination of many. 

> ### üîé Engage Critically 
> If you could, what questions would you want to ask the people who build these models?

### Toxicity analysis using Detoxify

The model we‚Äôll be using is called **Detoxify** (you can read more about it [here](https://github.com/unitaryai/detoxify?tab=readme-ov-file)). It was trained on large datasets of online comments across seven languages, including English and Russian. Detoxify provides an overall **toxicity score** for each text and can also detect five specific subtypes of toxicity: `identity_attack`, `insult`, `obscene`, `sexual_explicit`, and `threat`.

In the context of our dataset, propagandist tweets often aim to provoke strong emotions, spread hate, or stir conflict. Running toxicity analysis can help us investigate questions like:

- *Are propagandist tweets more toxic than non-propagandist ones?*
- *What types of toxic language are most common?*
- *Are there patterns in how toxicity is used to influence or manipulate public discourse?*

Toxicity analysis gives us another lens to understand how language and emotion are used in disinformation campaigns. Let‚Äôs begin by importing the necessary libraries and tools:

```{python}
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
from detoxify import Detoxify
from scipy.stats import ttest_ind, chi2_contingency

```

```{python}
detox = Detoxify("original")
```
