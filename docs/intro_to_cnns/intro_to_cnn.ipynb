        "\n",
        "What is the first thing that comes to your mind when you hear the word \"**neural network**\"? If you are thinking about the human brain and neurons, you are not wrong. In fact, the term \"neural network\" is inspired by the way how human brain and nervous systems work, where neurons are connected to each other and communicate with each other to process information. \n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of **machine learning**, a neural network, or more precisely, an **artificial neural network (ANN)** is defined as \"a program, or model, that makes decisions in a manner similar to the human brain, by using processes that mimic the way biological neurons work together to identify phenomena, weigh options and arrive at conclusions\".\n",
        "\n",
        "The definition seems way too formal and scientific, but we can easily translate it into daily language. Think of taking a closed-book multiple choice exam (Oops, gross). Your brain calls on a team of \"experts\", one for course facts, another for what you remember about the professor's hints in class, another for gut instincts, etc. When you read a question, each expert gives you a confidence score. You weight each score by how much you trust that expert, then add them up. The answer with the highest total \"trust $\\times$ confidence\" wins. After the exam, you see which answers were wrong and adjust those trust weights (trust the right experts more, the wrong ones less), and prepare for the next exam based on this experience. This exactly how a neural network makes decisions and learns via its **feedback loop**. Neural networks are following a similar thought and learning process as you and me, and this is why they are flexible and powerful, being able to handle complex, abstract tasks and evolve on their own, **like an intelligent creature**. \n",
        "\n",
        "While the core idea is not complex, you may want to master some bluffing terms to translate the professional discussions. In the example above, the \"experts\" you consulted in your mind are called **neurons**; the key clues you noticed when reading question are called **features**; your understanding of exam question is called the **input layer**; your thought process rounds are called **hidden layers**; your chosen answer is reflected as the **output layer**; the mind map that connects all the \"experts\" and input features is **architecture**; and each exam attempt with the review of feedback is called a **training epoch**. See, they are really not that deep! You now can also talk about it as an expert.\n",

        "Now that we understood what is an artificial neural network, let's dive into the real topic here: What's unique about **convolutional neural networks (CNNs)** and why they are revolutionary to computer vision and image processing? \n",
        "\n",
        "Let's start by discussing the unique point of CNNs. Imagine you are reading a bird guide and trying to learn the characteristics of a night heron and a grey heron so that you can easily distinguish between the two in the field, what would you do? I believe you would naturally try to observe the birds piece by piece: first comparing the features of the juveniles and adults, then noting how they look both in flight and on land. Gradually, your brain forms a complete comparison: the night heron has a shorter beak, a shorter neck, striking red eyes, and dark blue plumage as an adult; while the grey heron has a longer beak, a longer neck, yellow eyes, and wears grey color plumage. \n",

        "A convolutional neural network would read things in the same way, as it doesn't look at things in a big picture directly (which is usually costly and slow), but would see an image as multiple small **patches** to study the unique features and construct a detailed field guide of its own. The way how a CNN sees things this way is through **convolution**: it has a **convolutional layer** on top of the input layer to learn features piece by piece in its architecture, such that it can process information from an image in a cleverer way. Moreover, CNNs work quite well even when training images are not as tidy and organized as those in a field guide, which makes it efficient in solving real-life problems. \n",
        "\n",
        "Let's recall some basic concepts of convolution and see how they are applied in the CNNs, typically within the convolutional layer. Here, the **inputs** are images, and they are interpreted by a computer as grids of numbers. The **kernels** (also called filters) are still the \"brushes\" you apply on the input image to extract certain features, but in a CNN, there are usually multiple distinct kernels applied at the same time to extract and map different features. After different features are extracted, they will be pooled together with another kernel and produce a summarized output to be passed into the **fully-connected layer** for classification or other tasks.\n",

This somewhat shows the advantage of CNNs over humans when confronted with complex, blurry images, but CNNs have more applications than that. They power a host of real-world applications, from enabling your smartphone’s camera to automatically recognize faces and apply portrait effects, to guiding autonomous vehicles by detecting pedestrians, road signs, and lane markings in real time. In healthcare, CNNs help radiologists spot tumors in MRI and CT scans, and dermatologists classify skin lesions from photos.
