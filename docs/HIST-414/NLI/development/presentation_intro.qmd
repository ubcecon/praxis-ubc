## Overview of Historical Background 

**The 1884 Chinese Regulation Act** is widely regarded as one of the most notorious discriminatory provincial laws targeting Chinese immigration. This legislation was challenged and ultimately declared unconstitutional in the 1885 case of **R v. Wing Chong** by Justice Henry Pering Pellew Crease. 

However, whether this decision stemmed from genuine sympathy toward Chinese immigrants or was primarily motivated by economic concerns has remained a subject of ongoing debate among scholars of Canadian constitutional history.


## Overview of Our Study

In this study, we employ machine learning techniques, specifically text embeddings, to offer a novel perspective on this historical issue. Our methodology encompasses the following steps:

- Compiling a corpus of legal cases and commission reports authored by contemporary judges concerning Chinese immigrants.
- Applying context-based word embeddings to analyze prevailing attitudes toward Chinese immigrants during the period.
- Creating keyword-focused text embeddings and comparing the positions of Justice Crease, Justice Begbie, and the 1884 Chinese Regulation Act to elucidate differences in judicial stance.
- Conducting Topic Alignment Analysis to assess the relative emphasis on economic versus social justice concerns.
- Utilizing zero-shot classification to evaluate whether the discourse within these documents reflects pro-discrimination, neutral, or anti-discrimination positions.

## Overview of Our Data

Our dataset consists of 10 digitized and cleaned text documents, including 5 legal cases, 4 commission reports, and the original text of the 1884 Chinese Regulation Act of BC.

- We focus primarily on R v. Wing Chong, Wong Hoy Woon v. Duncan, R v. Mee Wah, R v. Victoria, and the Regulation Act itself, as these documents directly address Chinese immigration in BC during the period. 
- Reports authored by Crease and Begbie for the Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration are also included to provide insight into the judges’ perspectives. 
- The remaining documents serve to enrich our corpus for word embedding analysis and supplement our study.
