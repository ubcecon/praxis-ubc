## Section 2: Computational text analysis

We can split up ML-based NLP methods into two categories: **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning.

## 2.1 Supervised machine learning

In supervised learning, a model is trained on a dataset of documents that are *already assigned human-provided annotations*. The model first analyzes this pre-labeled data to learn the features (ex; lingustic patterns, structures, semantic relationships) associated with each category. Once trained, the model can then process new, *unseen* text for tasks like entity identification, sentiment analysis, translation, and other classification tasks. 

## 2.1.1 But first, text preprocessing...

Before we can proceed with an analysis of our texts, we need to *preprocess* them using a series of steps. We do this because supervised learning models cannot work with raw text^{1}. Models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Naive Bayes are fundamentally *mathematical algorithms* that operate on numerical data. They have no inherent ability to understand strings of text.

Text preprocessing usually involves the following steps:
1) Tokenization 
2) Text normalization (sometimes)
3) Stopword removal
4) Vectorization (BoW, TF-IDF, Embeddings)

## Tokenization and stopword removal

A **token** is a fundamental unit of text, often times a subword of a word, created by segmenting a larger string of text for a model to process.

```
Sentence: The pack of chihuahuas chased after the frightened cat.
List of tokens: ['the', 'pack', 'of', 'chihuahua', '##s', 'chased', 'after', 'the', 'frightened', 'cat', '.']
String of tokens: the pack of chihuahua ##s chased after the frightened cat .
```

An example using bert-based-uncased's autotokenizer. 

A **stopword** is an extremely common word, like "the," "a," or "is,", that is often removed from text during preprocessing as it carries virtually no meaningful information on its own. As these words add noise without contributing any unique information, removing them allows a model to focus on the more meaningful words that actually differentiate documents. 

```
Original Tokens:    ['the', 'pack', 'of', 'chihuahua', '##s', 'chased', 'after', 'the', 'frightened', 'cat', '.']
Tokens (stopwords removed):    ['pack', 'chihuahua', '##s', 'chased', 'frightened', 'cat', '.']
```

## To normalize, or not to normalize?

The recent consensus amogst researchers using NLP tools is that often times normalization methods are either redundant or counterproductive. Removing stopwords, for instance, is often moreso a cosmetic change than one that impacts the model. Likewise, stemming and lemmatization of tokens can reduce topic readability as well as conflate terms with different meanings^{2}. 

That's not to say don't remove stopwords/stem/lemmatize. Just dont do so blindly--  think very carefully about *why* you doing so and how it affects your model. 

## Vectorization: Bag of Words

ML models are fundamentally based on math, so they require structured numerical data. **Vectorization** is the process of translating unstructured text into a numerical format. Different vectorization techniques result in different interpretations of the resulting vectors of numbers. The two simplest vectorization methods are Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF.

- **Bag of Words**: Consider a spreadsheet where each column corresponds to a document, and each row is the *the number of times each word (in the document) shows up in the document*. For example, consider the sentence "The pack of chihuahuas chased after the frightened cat". The BoW representation of this sentence is $<2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1>$. 

Pros:
1) Resulting matrix values are extremely easy to interpret.
Cons: 
1) resulting matrix becomes very sparse very fast
2) Context-agnostic: "The dog chased after the cat" has the same matrix representation as "the cat chased after the dog".
3) **Every word is treated equally, so common words dominate.**

![BoW representation of two sentences](media/dogs_and_cats.png)

## Vectorization: Bag of Words (continued)

Recall the BoW representation of the two sentences from the previous slide. Now imagine if instead of each document being a single sentence, it was hundreds-- even after stopword removal, very frequent words would still dominate and be considered important. Are they actually important? Probably not.

## Vectorization: TF-IDF

What if instead of looking at aggregate counts for words, we looked at their *importance* relative to other documents? **TF-IDF** calculates a word's importance by multiplying its frequency within a document by a score that increases for words that are rare across the entire collection of documents, and penalises for words that are common across documents. 

- Note: TF-IDF works best with corpora containing many medium-length texts (ex; collections of news articles). In general, the more documents we have, the better this method will perform.

- tidytext
Python:

## 2.1.2 Supervised learning statistical frameworks

Supervised methods usually fall into two categories: regression and classification.

- **Regression** is used to predict numeric or continuous value (ex; predicting which year a given court case is from based on its' language)

- **Classification** is used to predict class labels or group membership (ex; predicting if the author of a tweet is a republican or democrat)

![An illustration of a regression task versus a classification task](media/regression_vs_classification.png)

## Some examples of supervised methods: Naive bayes

A **Naive bayes** classifier is used for predicting class labels for given series of texts. It operates under the assumption that across a given document, the presence of a particular word in a document is unrelated to the presence of any other word. From there, it calculates the probability of seeing each word within a given label (using the pre-labelled data) and then uses those pre-calculated probabilities to make an educated guess about which classes texts it hasn't seen before fit into.

- For example, suppose we are building a naive bayes model that attempts to classify texts based on if they were written by Jane Austen or Herman Melville. Let's say we give the model the following sentence: "The white whale swam in the sea." The key features the model would look at are the counts of the words: "white," "whale," "swam," and "sea."

- The model then calculates the probability of seeing these words based on their frequencies in the pre-labelled Austen and Melville texts that it was trained on. Since words like 'whale' and 'sea' are far more common in Melville's writing, the model assigns the sentence to belonging to the Melville class because that classification has the higher probability.

## Some examples of supervised methods: Logistic regression

**Logistic regression** is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks (ex; does a sentence belong to Melville or Austen's works), that calculates the probability of an outcome falling into one of two categories by fitting data to a special function called a sigmoid.

- Unlike Naive Bayes, logistic regression does not assume that features are independent; instead, it learns how they work together to influence which class a given text belongs to.

- Hence, it's known as a **discriminative model**, because it directly learns the boundary that distinguishes the classes, whereas Naive Bayes is a **generative model** that learns the characteristics of each class individually.

- Logistic regression works best when we have a greater need for model interpretability and probabalistic outputs, as the coefficients in a trained logistic regression model directly correspond to the influence of each feature on the outcome. (Ex; a high coefficient on the word "whale" directly indicates that its' presence significantly increases the calculated probability of a sentence being classified as a work of Herman Melville.)

![An example of the difference between generative and discriminative models.](media/gen_disc_model-1.png)

##  Some examples of supervised methods: Support Vector Machines

Wheras logistic regression models the probability of an observation belonging to a certain class by considering the influence of *all* data points, **Support Vector Machines** (SVMs) aim to find the best decision boundary ("best" being defined as the one that maximizes the distance between the different classes) focusing only on the **most difficult-to-classify points**. 

- SVM works best with High-Dimensional Data (small datasets with many unique words), when we want a clear margin of separation, and/or when our primary goal is soley classification and we don't need to know the specific probability of a data point belonging to a given class. 

## A comparison of the three methods on a binary classification task

Below are the results of running each of the three methods discussed on a set of sentences from Moby Dick and Emma. We've limited the bag of words vectorizer to build a vocabulary of the top 20 most frequent words, excluding common English stop words. 

![Logistic regression + PCA on sentences from *Moby Dick* and *Emma*.](media/logistic_reg_output.png)
![SVM + PCA on sentences from *Moby Dick* and *Emma*. Polynomial instead of linear kernel.](media/svm_output.png)
![Again, this time with Naive Bayes + PCA.](media/naive_bayes_output.png)

Note the axes-- we'll get into what PCA is shortly. 

## 2.2 Unsupervised learning 

Thus far, all the examples of statistical methods we've covered are instances of **supervised learning**. We already know what our labels are going to be, the task is assigning the right labels to the right sentences. But what if we didn't know what our labels were? What if we wanted to infer the labels soley from the features found within our data?

## 2.3 Natural Language Processing (brief)

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. By combining computational linguistics with machine learning and deep learning techniques, NLP allows machines to process language data, and reveal meaning. 

## 2.3.1 Dependency Relationships

At the core of NLP is the concept of dependency. Dependency is the process to analyze the grammatical structure in a sentence and find related words as well as the type of relationship between them. Each word’s grammatical role—such as subject, verb, or object contributes to the overall structure of the sentence. For example, in the sentence "He bought a car." The verb bought links all of the other words. He is the subject and the car is the object. Dependency parsing is the process by which these relationships are mapped out, creating a visual structure (called a parse tree) that makes the underlying grammatical links explicit. In computational linguistics and NLP, identifying these dependencies is fundamental for tasks like machine translation, question answering, and summarization.

An example of a parse tree for "He bought a new car."
![Parse Tree Example](media/parse_tree.png).

These parse trees help explain meanings in complex sentences for the computer. They make a map of semantic meaning. 

## 2.3.2 Named Entity Recognition (NER) / Object Detection 

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a technique in NLP that identifies and classifies named entities in text into predefined categories like person, organization, location, dates. A named entity is a real-world object that can be denoted with a proper name for instance: The University of British Columbia, Vancouver or August 20. "These categories can include, but are not limited to, names of individuals, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, medical codes, monetary values and percentages, among others. Essentially, NER is the process of taking a string of text (i.e., a sentence, paragraph or entire document), and identifying and classifying the entities that refer to each category." (IBM)

There are two steps in this process:

1. identifying the entity
2. categorizing it

An example of this could be scanning a stock market report and extracting names of stocks and dates. Here is an example of NER working on an article

![NER Example](media/Named-Entity-Recognition.jpg)

## 2.3.3 Grammatical Parsing

Grammatical parsing in NLP is the process of examining the grammatical structure and relationships inside a given sentence or text. "It involves analyzing the text to determine the roles of specific words, such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives, as well as their interrelationships" (Intellipaat). 

Rather than simply identifying individual words like in Named Entity Recognition, grammatical parsing uncovers how those words fit together. A significant part of this process is the parse tree from before, by constructing one of these the computer can gain an understanding of the structure. 

One possible technique is Top-Down Parsing. It begins with the highest-level rule and works downward, recursively expanding each non-terminal symbol until the entire sentence is derived. This method tries to match the input sentence with the grammatical structures prescribed by the language’s rules, starting from the broadest abstraction and breaking it down into smaller, more concrete units. 

Lets look at an example from Intellipaat with the sentance “John is playing a game” for this to work the parser already knows that **Sentence = S = Noun Phrase (NP)  + Verb Phrase (VP) + Preposition Phrase (PP)** is a valid grammatical form in English. 

![Example of Top Down Parsing](media/top_down_parsing.png)

In the image above the Top-Down Parser looks through identifing that John is a noun then moves back up and examines the next word until it finally reaches a full sentence structure.

## 2.5 AI ethics

Another very important component of doing text analysis and working with Aritifical Intelligence more generally is AI Ethics. From IBM: "Examples of AI ethics issues include data responsibility and privacy, fairness, explainability, robustness, transparency, environmental sustainability, inclusion, moral agency, value alignment, accountability, trust, and technology misuse."

Being mindful of AI ethics is present in all fields, but a example closer to text analysis is how NLP technologies interpret, classify, and often generate human language which is deeply tied to culture, identity, and communication. Without proper ethics considerations these technologies can create biases and discriminate. 

### 2.5.1 A Real World Example

A current case of AI Ethics being neglected comes from the sub-reddit r/changemyview. Where researchers from the University of Zurich conducted an unauthorized experiment to study AI-driven persuasion on real people. They used bots who posed as real people in order to try to persuade real people to changing their world views and posted over 1,700 comments. 

These AI bots pretended to be many things including:

* AI pretending to be a victim of rape
* AI acting as a trauma counselor specializing in abuse
* AI accusing members of a religious group of "caus[ing] the deaths of hundreds of innocent traders and farmers and villagers."
* AI posing as a black man opposed to Black Lives Matter
* AI posing as a person who received substandard care in a foreign hospital.

### 2.5.2 Results of the case

This study went against the rules posted on r/changemyview and a complaint was filled against the University of Zurich and the Institutional Review Board (IRB). This case reached the news being published in the Washington Post, Atlantic and Science.org. Following the news and intense criticism the researchers apologized and decided not to publish the formal results. 

The bottom line is **whenever performing any kind of research it is essential to be aware of ethics and proper conduct**.
