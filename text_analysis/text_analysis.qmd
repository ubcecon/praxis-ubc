## Section 1: Traditional qualitative coding  
Qualitative research often begins with **hand-coded analysis**, where researchers create a codebook and apply categories to text manually

**The convention**
Imagine you have a giant pile of stories, surveys or interviews, researchers first make a **list of buckets** (this list is called a *codebook*). Then one by one,  they **read the text and put each piece into the right bucket**. Examples of buckets might be, happy, angry, sad, about money, about family, etc.

## Inductive Coding 
![](media/DeductiveCoding.webp){fig-align="center" width="40%" fig-cap="Deductive coding: start with pre-set categories and apply them to text."}

##
This is called **hand-coding** because people do it by hand and not a computer. It works well but its slow and requires people who have been expertly trained. It also works the other way around, **you can read the text and come up with buckets.**

![](media/InductiveCoding.webp){fig-align="center" width="40%" fig-cap="Inductive coding: categories emerge from the text during analysis."}

## Example
Imagine coding voter interviews into pre-set buckets like **Economy, Healthcare, Immigration**.

::: {.smaller}
| Comment                                | Code (Bucket) | Why?                                                |
|----------------------------------------|---------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| “Groceries and gas are too expensive.” | Economy       | Clearly about financial concerns.                   |
| “I want better access to doctors.”     | Healthcare    | Fits the “Healthcare” bucket.                       |
| “The government should secure the border.” | Immigration | Matches the “Immigration” bucket.                   |
| “I don’t trust politicians at all.”    | (none)        | Doesn’t fit the pre-set buckets, so it’s skipped.   |
:::

Coding helps researchers move from raw words to structured insights. It turns scattered comments into clear evidence about what people care about.

<!-- ## 1.1 Example Hand-Coding financial decisions

Researchers re-analyzed **32 focus group transcripts** on how people make financial decisions.  
A team of six coders manually created categories like *credit reports*, *auto purchases*, and *rules of thumb*, and then assigned text line-by-line. This showed how traditional hand-coding can reveal patterns in how people think about money, but also how labor-intensive the process is.   -->

## 1.1 Recent updates

###### Newer way: crowdsourcing  

Hand-coding takes a long time. So now, people sometimes ask **lots of regular internet workers** to help.  

###### Examples 
- [Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk)](https://www.mturk.com/)  
 MTurk is an online marketplace for small tasks. Researchers or companies post simple jobs (like labeling sentences, clicking through images, or filling surveys). Workers around the world complete these tasks for small payments.In research, MTurk is often used to quickly get lots of human-coded data without hiring a big team of experts. An example of this could be, A researcher who uploads 1,000 tweets and asks MTurk workers to tag them as positive, negative, or neutral.
- [Prolific Academic](https://www.prolific.com/academic-researchers)  
  Prolific is also an online platform for research participants, but it’s designed specifically for academic studies. Participants sign up to take part in surveys, experiments, and labeling tasks. Researchers like it because Prolific tends to have higher-quality, more reliable participants compared to MTurk. It also gives access to specific demographics (age, country, education, etc.), which is useful for social science studies.An example of this could be, A political science researcher who runs a survey about voting behavior, targeting only UK residents, using Prolific.

## Inter-Coder Reliability

Instead of only using experts, researchers **pay many workers online** to sort the text.  
- **Good part:** This is way faster.  
- **Bad part:** Workers don't always agree. For instance you and I may disagree wether pineapple belongs on pizza.    

When two researchers code the same text, they don’t always agree.  
- One coder might tag *“My boss always calls me by a nickname instead of my real name”* as **Workplace Inequality**.  
- Another coder might put it under **Identity & Respect**.  

::: callout-note
Why it matters: Inter-coder reliability helps show that your coding system is **trustworthy** and not just one person’s opinion.
:::

**How do researchers measure agreement?**
- **Percent Agreement**  
  Just count how often coders pick the same label. This is easy, but doesn’t account for chance.
- **Cohen’s Kappa (κ)**  
  Adjusts for agreement that could happen just by chance. Values range from -1 (no agreement) to 1 (perfect agreement).
- **Krippendorff’s Alpha**  
  More flexible. Works with multiple coders, different types of data, and missing values.  
  *Often used in social science research.*

This is all the “old school” part of text analysis.  
Next, we’ll see how **computers and machine learning** tackle this process. 

## Section 2: Computational text analysis

We can split up ML-based NLP methods into two categories: **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning.

## 2.1 Supervised machine learning

In supervised learning, a model is trained on a dataset of documents that are *already assigned human-provided annotations*. The model first analyzes this pre-labeled data to learn the features (ex: lingustic patterns, structures, semantic relationships) associated with each category. Once trained, the model can then process new, *unseen* text for tasks like entity identification, sentiment analysis, translation, and other classification tasks. 

## 2.1.1 But first, text preprocessing...

Before we can proceed with an analysis of our texts, we need to *preprocess* them using a series of steps. We do this because supervised learning models cannot work with raw text^[1]. Models like Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Naive Bayes are fundamentally *mathematical algorithms* that operate on numerical data. They have no inherent ability to understand strings of text.

Text preprocessing usually involves the following steps:
1) Tokenization 
2) Text normalization (sometimes)
3) Stopword removal
4) Vectorization (BoW, TF-IDF, Embeddings)

::: aside
True for classical models. However even modern models like GPTs still work with numerical representations of textual data under the hood, even if they take in raw text as inputs. 
:::

## Tokenization and stopword removal

A **token** is a fundamental unit of text, often times a word, or a subword of a word, created by segmenting a larger string of text for a model to process.

```
Sentence: The pack of chihuahuas chased after the frightened cat.
List of tokens: ['the', 'pack', 'of', 'chihuahua', '##s', 'chased', 'after', 'the', 'frightened', 'cat', '.']
String of tokens: the pack of chihuahua ##s chased after the frightened cat .
```

An example using bert-based-uncased's autotokenizer. 

A **stopword** is an extremely common word, like "the," "a," or "is,", that is often removed from text during preprocessing as it carries virtually no meaningful information on its own. As these words add noise without contributing any unique information, removing them allows a model to focus on the more meaningful words that actually differentiate documents. 

```
Original Tokens:    ['the', 'pack', 'of', 'chihuahua', '##s', 'chased', 'after', 'the', 'frightened', 'cat', '.']
Tokens (stopwords removed):    ['pack', 'chihuahua', '##s', 'chased', 'frightened', 'cat', '.']
```

## Text normalization

Sometimes, a researcher may want to add a few additional preprocessing steps. These can include:

- Stemming: Reducing words to their root form, or stem. 
- Lemmatization: Reducing a word to its base or dictionary form, known as the lemma

Text normalization can often be useful, but it isn't strictly necessary. In fact, stemming and lemmatization of tokens can reduce topic readability as well as conflate terms with different meanings^[2]. That's not to say don't stem/lemmatize, just dont do so blindly--  think very carefully about *why* you doing so and how it affects your model. 

::: aside
Consult [Maria Antoniak's guide](https://maria-antoniak.github.io/2022/07/27/topic-modeling-for-the-people.html) on when to/when not to normalize tokens.

## Vectorization: Bag of Words

ML models are fundamentally based on math, so they require structured numerical data. **Vectorization** is the process of translating unstructured text into a numerical format. Different vectorization techniques result in different interpretations of the resulting vectors of numbers. The two simplest vectorization methods are Bag of Words (BoW) and TF-IDF.

- **Bag of Words**: Consider a spreadsheet where each column corresponds to a document, and each row is the *the number of times each word (in the document) shows up in the document*. For example, consider the sentence "The pack of chihuahuas chased after the frightened cat". The BoW representation of this sentence is $<2,1,1,1,1,1,1,1>$. 

Pros:
1) Resulting matrix values are extremely easy to interpret.
Cons: 
1) Resulting matrix becomes very sparse very fast.
2) Context-agnostic: "The dog chased after the cat" has the same matrix representation as "the cat chased after the dog".
3) **Every word is treated equally, so common words dominate.**

![BoW representation of two sentences](media/dogs_and_cats.png)

## Vectorization: Bag of Words (continued)

Recall the BoW representation of the two sentences from the previous slide. Now imagine if instead of each document being a single sentence, it was hundreds-- even after stopword removal, very frequent words would still dominate and be considered important. Are they actually important? Probably not. 

![A BoW matrix comparing Jane Austen's "Emma" and Moby Dick.](media/bow_matrix.png)

## Vectorization: TF-IDF

What if instead of looking at aggregate counts for words, we looked at their *importance* relative to other documents? **TF-IDF** calculates a word's importance by multiplying its frequency within a document by a score that increases for words that are rare across the entire collection of documents, and penalises for words that are common across documents. 

- Note: TF-IDF works best with corpora containing many medium-length texts (ex: collections of news articles). In general, the more documents we have, the better this method will perform.

## Some useful libraries: 

For R:
- SnowballC
- tidytext
Python:
- Scikit-learn
- nltk

## 2.1.2 Supervised learning statistical frameworks

Supervised methods usually fall into two categories: regression and classification.

- **Regression** is used to predict numeric or continuous value (ex: predicting which year a given court case is from based on its language)

- **Classification** is used to predict class labels or group membership (ex: predicting if the author of a tweet is a Republican or Democrat)

![An illustration of a regression task versus a classification task. Credit to ](media/regression_vs_classification.png)

## Some examples of supervised methods: Naive Bayes

A **Naive Bayes** classifier is used for predicting class labels for given series of texts. It operates under the assumption that across a given document, the presence of a particular word in a document is unrelated to the presence of any other word. From there, it calculates the probability of seeing each word within a given label (using the pre-labelled data) and then uses those pre-calculated probabilities to make an educated guess about which classes texts it hasn't seen before fit into.

- For example, suppose we are building a Naive Bayes model that attempts to classify texts based on if they were written by Jane Austen or Herman Melville. Let's say we give the model the following sentence: "The white whale swam in the sea." The key features the model would look at are the counts of the words: "white," "whale," "swam," and "sea."

- The model then calculates the probability of seeing these words based on their frequencies in the pre-labelled Austen and Melville texts that it was trained on. Since words like 'whale' and 'sea' are far more common in Melville's writing, the model assigns the sentence to belonging to the Melville class because that classification has the higher probability.

## Some examples of supervised methods: Logistic regression

**Logistic regression** is a statistical method used for binary classification tasks (ex: does a sentence belong to Melville or Austen's works), that calculates the probability of an outcome falling into one of two categories by fitting data to a special function called a sigmoid.

- Unlike Naive Bayes, logistic regression does not assume that features are independent; instead, it learns how they work together to influence which class a given text belongs to.

- Hence, it's known as a **discriminative model**, because it directly learns the boundary that distinguishes the classes, whereas Naive Bayes is a **generative model** that learns the characteristics of each class individually.

- Logistic regression works best when we have a greater need for model interpretability and probabalistic outputs, as the coefficients in a trained logistic regression model directly correspond to the influence of each feature on the outcome. (ex: a high coefficient on the word "whale" directly indicates that its' presence significantly increases the calculated probability of a sentence being classified as a work of Herman Melville.)

![An example of the difference between generative and discriminative models. Credit to the LearnOpenCV team for this image.](media/gen_disc_model-1.png)

##  Some examples of supervised methods: Support Vector Machines

Wheras logistic regression models the probability of an observation belonging to a certain class by considering the influence of *all* data points, **Support Vector Machines** (SVMs) aim to find the best decision boundary ("best" being defined as the one that maximizes the distance between the different classes) focusing only on the **most difficult-to-classify points**. 

- SVM works best with High-Dimensional Data (small datasets with many unique words), when we want a clear margin of separation, and/or when our primary goal is soley classification and we don't need to know the specific probability of a data point belonging to a given class. 

## A comparison of the three methods on a binary classification task

Below are the results of running each of the three methods discussed on a set of sentences from Moby Dick and Emma. We've limited the bag of words vectorizer to build a vocabulary of the top 20 most frequent words, excluding common English stop words. 

![Logistic regression + PCA on sentences from *Moby Dick* and *Emma*.](media/logistic_reg_output.png)
![SVM + PCA on sentences from *Moby Dick* and *Emma*. Polynomial instead of linear kernel.](media/svm_output.png)
![Again, this time with Naive Bayes + PCA.](media/naive_bayes_output.png)

## 2.2 Unsupervised learning 

Thus far, all the examples of statistical methods we've covered are instances of **supervised learning**. We already know what our labels are going to be, the task is assigning the right labels to the right sentences. But what if we didn't know what our labels were? What if we wanted to infer the labels soley from the features found within our data? 

- **Unsupervised learning** uses ML algorithms to discover hidden patterns and structures in our data, based *solely on its features*, without any predefined labels to guide the process. 

-  Examples include: Clustering, topic modelling, word embeddings

## 2.2.1 Topic modelling

A **topic** is a label that is assigned to textual data which details the subjects within the text^[3]. Consider the following two sentences:

1) French cuisine is some of the best in the world, despite the often lack of spices. 

2) I've always loved Japanese food, mainly because I prefer fish raw rather than cooked. 

What topic would you assign to each of the two texts? "French food" and "Japanese food" might come to mind. What about the next pair of sentences?

1) French cuisine is some of the best in the world, despite the often lack of spices. 

2) Dogs are very loud and unhygenic, yet people still love having them around. 

What topics would you assign now? Even though sentence 1 is the same as in the previous example, a more general description of "food" might make more sense here. The point is that **topics are corpus-specific**. The topics we assign to a given text are not just dependent on the text itself, but on the other texts surrounding it. 

A **cluster** is the formal name for the group of texts that an algorithm identifies as being similar *before* we assign a topic label. The goal of a clustering algorithm is to find these natural groupings in the data automatically, *without* any human guidance.

:::

## 2.2.2 Hard Clustering methods: K-means and Hierarchical clustering

We can partition clustering methods into two sets: hard clustering methods and soft clustering methods. **Hard clustering methods** assign texts to *a single* topic. For example, a text can either be about food, about dogs, but not both. The two most famous examples of this are k-means and hierarchical clustering.

- **K-means Clustering** is the simplest form of clustering: it randomly creates *k* cluster centers, then iteratively changes them to minimize euclidian distance. K-means requires the researcher to set the number of cluster centers, so it's best suited when there's a clear hypothsis about the expected number of clusters. 

- **Hierarchical Clustering** is a method of cluster analysis that seeks to build a hierarchy of clusters. It groups data points into a tree-like structure, called a dendrogram, without requiring the number of clusters to be predetermined. The algorithm works by either progressively merging the closest clusters (agglomerative) or by starting with one giant cluster and progressively splitting it (divisive). A researcher can then decide how many clusters to use by "cutting" the resulting tree at a given height. 

- Use Hierarchical Clustering when the number of natural clusters in the text is unknown, and the primary goal is to simply explore the relationships between documents. Ideal for small(er) datasets. 

## 2.2.3 Soft Clustering methods: LDA for topic modelling

**Latent Dirichlet Allocation** (LDA) is an unsupervised learning algorithm used for topic modeling, that discovers topics from a collection of documents by identifying words that frequently appear together. LDA is a *soft clustering* method: it can assign a given text from a corpus to *more than one topic*. LDA works by assuming that each document is a mixture of various underlying topics (and in turn, that each topic is a mixture of words). Then, the algorithm tries to figure out which words belong to which topics, and which topics belong to which documents. 

- Like K-means, the number of topics must be specified manually, with there being no right answer. It quickly becomes a game of trial and error.

- LDA is ultimately a BoW model, so it doesn't understand context. Adding bigrams/trigrams might help, but polysemy remains an issue.


## 2.2.4 LDA as a method of dimensionality reduction

Despite these limitations, LDA is still an extemely powerful tool for unsupervised topic discovery, and reduces dimensionality in a meaningful way: instead of using thousands of words as features for a supervised ML model, we can instead use the topic distributions from LDA.

![Naive Bayes on the Emma/Moby Dick dataset. This time, each sentence's position is determined by the prevalence of topics, discovered via LDA.](media/naive_bayes_lda_topics.png)


## 2.2.5 Embeddings

Recall how we mentioned vectorization methods like BoW and TF-IDF are context insensitive? **Word embeddings are another vector representation of text**, which is context-senstive. In short, a word embedding model is trained on a massive corpus of text to create dense numerical vectors for words by learning from their context. We can then apply that word embedding model onto our own corpus to generate a set of *context-sensitive* vectors for our texts. 

- Consider the sentences: *The film was incredible.* and *That movie is amazing.*. A BoW model only cares about word counts, so it would conclude that the sentences are completely unrelated (no words are in common!). With Word2Vec, the word *film* lies closely to *movie* in an embedding space. Likewise, *incredible* and *amazing* sit closely together.

- As word embeddings capture semantic meaning, a word embedding model would correctly notice that the two sentences are quite similar. 

- **Word2Vec** is a common technique for creating word embeddings, which it accomplishes using either a **Skip-Gram** or **CBOW** architecture. A CBOW model learns by using surrounding context words to predict a masked target word. Coversely, a Skip-Gram model uses a provided target word to predict the surrounding context words. 

### 2.2.6 Return to unsupervised methods: BERT

The primary issue with Word2Vec is that the resulting vector representations are *static*: each word has exactly one, fixed vector representation. Hence, the vector representations of the words in the sentences "The dog chased after the cat" and "The cat chased after the dog" are identical. What if instead we could generate **dynamic embeddings**, that change based on our textual corpus? 

- Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (colloquially called BERT) generates such dynamic embeddings using a mix of self-attention and positional encodings: to generate a vector representation for a word, it looks at the entire sentence surrounding it weighing the relationship between every word. Additionally, it makes note of the exact sequence of words, establishing subject-object relationships.

- In our "The dog chased the cat" and "The cat chased the dog" examples, BERT would correctly understand that the subject-object roles are reversed, and hence assign two different meanings. 

### BERT, continued

![Our initial Naive Bayes classifier, this time with dynamic embeddings generated with BERT. Note the great variation, yet still highly distinct classes.](media/naive_bayes_BERT.png)

## 2.3 Natural Language Processing

Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that enables computers to understand, interpret, and generate human language. By combining computational linguistics with machine learning and deep learning techniques, NLP allows machines to process language data, and reveal meaning. 

## 2.3.1 Dependency Relationships

At the core of NLP is the concept of dependency. Dependency is the process to analyze the grammatical structure in a sentence and find related words as well as the type of relationship between them. Each word’s grammatical role—such as subject, verb, or object contributes to the overall structure of the sentence. For example, in the sentence "He bought a car." The verb bought links all of the other words. He is the subject and the car is the object. Dependency parsing is the process by which these relationships are mapped out, creating a visual structure (called a parse tree) that makes the underlying grammatical links explicit. In computational linguistics and NLP, identifying these dependencies is fundamental for tasks like machine translation, question answering, and summarization.

An example of a parse tree for "He bought a new car."
![Parse Tree Example](media/parse_tree.png).

These parse trees help explain meanings in complex sentences for the computer. They make a map of semantic meaning. 

## 2.3.2 Named Entity Recognition (NER) / Object Detection 

Named Entity Recognition (NER) is a technique in NLP that identifies and classifies named entities in text into predefined categories like person, organization, location, dates. A named entity is a real-world object that can be denoted with a proper name for instance: The University of British Columbia, Vancouver or August 20. "These categories can include, but are not limited to, names of individuals, organizations, locations, expressions of times, quantities, medical codes, monetary values and percentages, among others. Essentially, NER is the process of taking a string of text (i.e., a sentence, paragraph or entire document), and identifying and classifying the entities that refer to each category." (IBM)

There are two steps in this process:

1. identifying the entity
2. categorizing it

An example of this could be scanning a stock market report and extracting names of stocks and dates. Here is an example of NER working on an article

![NER Example](media/Named-Entity-Recognition.jpg)

The image above is from <cogitotech.com>.

## 2.3.3 Grammatical Parsing

Grammatical parsing in NLP is the process of examining the grammatical structure and relationships inside a given sentence or text. "It involves analyzing the text to determine the roles of specific words, such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives, as well as their interrelationships" (Intellipaat). 

Rather than simply identifying individual words like in Named Entity Recognition, grammatical parsing uncovers how those words fit together. A significant part of this process is the parse tree from before, by constructing one of these the computer can gain an understanding of the structure. 

One possible technique is Top-Down Parsing. It begins with the highest-level rule and works downward, recursively expanding each non-terminal symbol until the entire sentence is derived. This method tries to match the input sentence with the grammatical structures prescribed by the language’s rules, starting from the broadest abstraction and breaking it down into smaller, more concrete units. 

Lets look at an example from Intellipaat with the sentance “John is playing a game” for this to work the parser already knows that **Sentence = S = Noun Phrase (NP)  + Verb Phrase (VP) + Preposition Phrase (PP)** is a valid grammatical form in English. 

![Example of Top Down Parsing](media/top_down_parsing.png)

In the image above the Top-Down Parser looks through identifing that John is a noun then moves back up and examines the next word until it finally reaches a full sentence structure. 


## 2.4 Recent Updates

###### Learning goals (2–3 minutes)
- Differentiate **encoder** vs **decoder** style models at a glance
- Understand **what NLI is** and how it enables **zero-shot** labeling
- Know the four **modern workflows**: zero-shot, few-shot, **RAG**, fine-tuning
- Grasp **privacy trade-offs**: APIs, chat, local vs. cloud

Before diving into LLMs and its specific methods, let’s zoom out and see the **big picture of transformer families** (the brains behind LLMs).  

## Encoders vs. Decoders: Three Families of Transformer Models  

Think of transformers as “readers” and “writers.”  

1. **Encoder-only** → the readers which are best at understanding text (BERT, RoBERTa).  
2. **Decoder-only** → the writers which are best at generating text (GPT, Claude, LLaMA).  
3. **Encoder–decoder** → readers + writers which are best at transforming one text into another (translation, summarization),(T5, BART).

Keep this short: “We’re covering concepts only. Think ‘what exists and why it matters.’”

## 2.4.1 Natural Language Inference (NLI) and Zero-Shot Learning

**What is Natural Language Inference (NLI)?**
Natural Language Inference (NLI) is a task where a model is given two sentences and must decide if the second sentence makes sense based on the first.  

Think of a student passing an exam on a subject they’ve never really studied before. That works because humans generalize from what they know.  Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) lets models do the same — applying knowledge to new tasks without ever seeing examples.  [Zero-Shot Text Classification](https://medium.com/@asanchezyali/zero-shot-text-classification-c737db000005)

- **Premise** = the original statement.  
- **Hypothesis** = the statement we want to check against the premise.  

The model has to choose between three possibilities:  
1. **Entailment (Yes)** — the hypothesis fits with the premise.  
2. **Contradiction (No)** — the hypothesis clashes with the premise.  
3. **Neutral (Maybe)** — there isn’t enough information to decide.  

## **Example**

| Premise                   | Hypothesis                  | Answer Type           | Why?                                                   |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| A man is riding a bicycle. | A man is outdoors.          | **Entailment (Yes)**  | Riding a bike usually implies being outside.           |
| A man is riding a bicycle. | A man is swimming.          | **Contradiction (No)**| You cannot ride a bike and swim at the same time.      |
| A man is riding a bicycle. | The man is wearing a helmet.| **Neutral (Maybe)**   | The premise doesn’t tell us if he is wearing a helmet. |


This is important because it shows the model isn’t just matching words, it’s making an **inference about meaning (reasoning)**.


## From NLI to Zero-Shot Learning  
Now imagine this: A student is able to pass an exam on a subject they’ve never studied. They do it by **generalizing** knowledge from other subjects.  

Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) works the same way for AI. Instead of needing thousands of training examples for a task, we can reframe classification as an NLI problem:  

- The **premise** is the text we want to classify.  
- The **hypotheses** are the possible labels, rewritten as simple sentences.  
  - Example: *“This review is positive.”*, *“This review is negative.”*, *“This review is neutral.”*  

The model then tests: *Does the premise support this hypothesis?* The one that fits best is then chosen as the label.  

**Example**  
- Premise: *“The café’s coffee is absolutely amazing!”*  
- Hypotheses:  
  1. *“This review is positive.”*  
  2. *“This review is negative.”*  
  3. *“This review is neutral.”*  
- Model’s answer: **Positive** — no labeled training data required.

## Why BERT Matters for NLI and Zero-Shot
For years, teaching computers to classify text meant building huge labeled datasets. You had to hand-code thousands of examples. You had to teach the student (the model) before it could pass the exam. This was expensive and time-consuming.

This changed with **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**  
- Released by Google in 2018 [Original Paper: *BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding* (Devlin et al., 2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.04805), it was the first widely adopted **encoder-only transformer**.  
- Reads text in **both directions** (left-to-right and right-to-left), capturing full context.  
- Pretrained on large text corpora, then fine-tuned for specific tasks.  

**Why it was a breakthrough**  
- Earlier models only saw text one way or used static word embeddings.  
- BERT allowed deep understanding of meaning in context (e.g., “bank” in “river bank” vs. “bank account”).  
- Set new performance records on tasks like NLI, question answering, and classification.  
- Remains the backbone of modern **zero-shot and inference tasks**.  

## With NLI-based zero-shot methods, we can:  
- **Scale** human codebooks or categories across very large corpus.  
- **Prototype quickly** test out categories before committing to labeling thousands of documents.  
- **Explore free-text responses** in surveys or interviews without heavy preprocessing. You don't need to read an entire review to tell the customer is unhappy. 

These methods are powered by **encoder-only transformers (models designed mainly to read text)** like BERT, RoBERTa, and DeBERTa, which are strong at understanding relationships between sentences. 
- **Before ~2020** Zero-shot classification was rare because models lacked the scale and pretraining needed to generalize without labeled examples (They weren't smart enough). 
- **Now** With strong NLI models, we can classify text cheaply and effectively even without training data (teaching the model). 

**Applications**  
- Identifying harmful or discriminatory language in online communities  
- Grouping open-ended survey responses into themes (positive, negative, political, etc.) 
- Quickly scanning archival or policy documents for relevant topics  


## Beyond Text: Zero-Shot in Vision  
Zero-shot learning is not just for text. Vision-language systems combine images and text in the same “meaning space.” This allows a model to classify **images it has never seen before** using natural-language descriptions.  

For example, given a new photo of an animal, the model can choose between descriptions like *“a photo of a zebra”* or *“a photo of a horse”* — even if “zebra” was never explicitly labeled in its training data.

## 2.4.2 Classification and discovery using decoder only models
**What are they?**  
Decoder-only transformers (pattern matchers like GPT) generate text one word at a time. With the right prompts, they can **classify, summarize, or find patterns**.
**Why it matters :**  
- Works without special training for many tasks.   
- Lets us explore and scale categories quickly.  
- Used in most modern chatbots and APIs (ChatGPT, Claude, LLaMA, etc.).

###### Using these models in practice :

**APIs vs. Chat**  
- *APIs*: They allow you to connect the model to your own system. Good for automation.  
- *Chat UIs*: Easy to use and quick. Good for testing ideas. 
**Local vs. Cloud**  
- *Local*: data stays private; needs hardware. 
- *Cloud*: easy access; data leaves your system.  

**Applications**  
- Auto-tagging document and moderating text   
- Detecting customers intent in messages   
- Drafting summaries and themes  

::: callout-important
**Watch outs**
- Models can “hallucinate” (make things up).
- Results depend on how you phrase the prompt.
- Privacy risks if data leaves your system.
- Costs add up if used at scale.

## 2.4.2.1 Four Ways to Guide Large Language Models 

There are **four main ways** we can get large language models (LLMs) to handle classification or generation tasks. They range from the simplest, asking the model directly (such as when we generally use ChatGPT), to the most advanced — retraining it on your own data (teaching a model). 

1. **Zero-shot** : Ask the model directly. No training data.  
*Example:* “Classify this as positive or negative.”
2. **Few-shot** : Add a handful of examples to guide the model.  
*Example:* Show 3 labeled reviews, then give it a new one.
3. **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** : Model looks up facts from your own documents and uses what it already knows.  
*Why:* reduces “hallucinations” and keeps answers grounded.
4. **Fine-tuning** : Retrain the model on your data (eg. specialising in Legal text)  
*Best for:* consistent style, domain knowledge, large-scale use.

::: callout-tip
Think of it as a ladder:  
Start with **zero-shot**, move up to **few-shot**, then **RAG**, and finally **fine-tuning**.Each step gives the model more guidance.

## 2.4.2.2 LLMs: APIs vs. Chat-Based Interfaces  

LLMs can be used in **two main ways**:  
1. **APIs** to connect the model into your own systems.  
2. **Chat-based interfaces** interact directly through a conversational window.

Both have strengths and weaknesses, depening on their applications. 

## APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)  
Think of an API as a “pipeline.” You send text to the model in the background, and it sends a response back. There is no chat window, it runs quietly inside your systems.  
**Strengths**  
- Its great for **automation** (batch jobs, workflows, scheduled tasks).  
- Can **integrate with existing apps** (e.g., surveys, chatbots, customer support).  
- Scales to handle **large datasets** consistently.  

::: callout-note
**Use Case: Parliamentary Debates with APIs**  
Suppose you have thousands of pages of parliamentary debate transcripts. An API can automatically sort speeches into categories like **economic policy**, **immigration**, or **climate change** — without hand-labeling every document.  

This helps researchers trace how issues rise and fall over time, while still leaving room for close reading of key passages.
:::

**Limitations**  
- Needs **technical setup** (developers, coding, integration).  
- Not designed for **interactive exploration** — you don’t “chat,” you send structured requests, usually in the form of code. 



## Chat-Based Interfaces  
  This is the familiar **conversational window** — you type, the model replies.  

**Strengths**  
- Extremely **intuitive** — no setup required.  
- Perfect for **brainstorming, Q&A, and demos**.  
- Great for **quick experiments** when you want to test an idea on the fly.  

**Limitations**  
- Harder to **scale or automate** (each interaction is manual).  
- Answers may be **less consistent** in formatting compared to API outputs.  

###### Why This Matters (At a Glance)  
- **APIs** = best for *quiet, large-scale automation and production systems*.  
- **Chat** = best for *human-in-the-loop exploration and design*.  

In practice, most research teams combine both approaches:  
- Use **chat interfaces** to quickly test categories or explore how a model interprets a few interview excerpts.  
- Use **APIs** to scale up, applying those same categories across thousands of transcripts, survey responses, or archival documents.  


## 2.4.2.3 Local models vs. sending data to a company
**The choice:**  
Do you run the model **on your own machine (local)**, or do you **send data to a company’s servers (cloud/hosted APIs)**?

::: callout-important
**UBC Policy Reminder**  
All researchers at UBC must follow UBC’s data security and privacy rules.  
- Only certain AI models and platforms are permitted for research use.  
- Models that send data outside Canada (e.g., some commercial APIs) are restricted.  
- For instance tools like *DeepSeek* are **not approved** for handling research data.  
- When in doubt, consult UBC’s [Research Ethics Board](https://ethics.research.ubc.ca/) or IT guidelines before uploading sensitive material.  

**Rule of thumb:** If your data includes interviews, transcripts, or personal information, you likely need to keep it local or use UBC-approved services.
:::

## Local Models
- Data stays in your own environment, so you have more **privacy & control**.  
- No outside company sees your text.  
- Good for sensitive data (health, finance, legal).  
- Downsides: needs **hardware (GPUs, storage)** and technical setup.


## Cloud / Hosted APIs
- Example: OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Microsoft.  
- **Fast start, easy to use**; no setup needed.  
- Access to **state-of-the-art** models.  
- Downsides: data leaves your system, subject to **company policies**.  
- Pay per use; can be expensive at scale. 

::: callout-important
**Cost Watch: APIs at Scale**
API pricing typically depends on how many *tokens* (pieces of text) you send and receive. For example:

- **GPT-4.5** costs about **$75 per 1 million input tokens** and **$150 per 1 million output tokens**. 

**Scenario:** If a company processes **10,000 reviews/day**, each 100 input + 50 output tokens:

- With GPT-4.5:  
  - Input cost = (10,000 × 100) / 1M × $75 ≈ **$75**  
  - Output cost = (10,000 × 50) / 1M × $150 ≈ **$75**  
  - **Total ≈ $150/day → ~$4,500/month**

## Quick Comparison

| Local Models              | Cloud/Hosted APIs       |
|---------------------------|-------------------------|
| Privacy & control         | Easy & instant access   |
| Needs hardware setup      | No setup needed         |
| Good for sensitive data   | Best models available   |
| Higher upfront effort     | Ongoing usage costs     |

::: callout-important
**Rule of thumb:**  
- If privacy is critical use a **local model**.  
- If speed & cutting-edge accuracy matter use **cloud APIs**.

## 2.5 AI ethics

Another very important component of doing text analysis and working with Aritifical Intelligence more generally is AI Ethics. From IBM: "Examples of AI ethics issues include data responsibility and privacy, fairness, explainability, robustness, transparency, environmental sustainability, inclusion, moral agency, value alignment, accountability, trust, and technology misuse."

Being mindful of AI ethics is present in all fields, but an example closer to text analysis is how NLP technologies interpret, classify, and often generate human language which is deeply tied to culture, and identity. Without proper ethics considerations these technologies can create biases and discriminate. All pre-trained word embedding models are inherently biased because they learn patterns from large corpora which can often reflect social or historical inequalities. An example of this could be linking certain jobs with one gender or groups with a stereotype. 

Some solutions to this are training a model from scratch with carefully curated data (which can be very costly). You can also attempt to use bias mitigation techniques like fine-tuning the model or using adversarial training. Both of these techniques still do not fully eliminate the bias just mitigate it, so it is important to acknowledge and sign the bias in any work you are doing. This allows readers to understand the limitations of the model and have a greater understanding of the results. 

### 2.5.1 A Real World Example

A current case of AI Ethics being neglected comes from the sub-reddit r/changemyview. Where researchers from the University of Zurich conducted an unauthorized experiment to study AI-driven persuasion on real people. They used bots who posed as real people in order to try to persuade real people to changing their world views and posted over 1,700 comments. 

These AI bots pretended to be many things including:

* AI pretending to be a victim of rape
* AI acting as a trauma counselor specializing in abuse
* AI accusing members of a religious group of "caus[ing] the deaths of hundreds of innocent traders and farmers and villagers."
* AI posing as a black man opposed to Black Lives Matter
* AI posing as a person who received substandard care in a foreign hospital.

### 2.5.2 Results of the case

This study went against the rules posted on r/changemyview and a complaint was filled against the University of Zurich and the Institutional Review Board (IRB). Even the IRB is not perfect as the study recieved IRB approval beforehand. This case reached the news being published in the Washington Post, Atlantic and Science.org. Following the news and intense criticism the researchers apologized and decided not to publish the formal results. 

The bottom line is **whenever performing any kind of research it is essential to be aware of ethics and proper conduct**.
