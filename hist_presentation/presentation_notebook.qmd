## Overview of Historical Background 

*The 1884 Chinese Regulation Act* is widely regarded as one of the most notorious discriminatory provincial laws targeting Chinese immigration. 

* This legislation was challenged and ultimately declared unconstitutional in the 1885 case of *R v. Wing Chong** 
* The Justice Henry Pering Pellew Crease found the legislation to be unconstitutional on economic grounds; infringing on federal authority over immigration, trade, commerce, treaty-making, and taxation. 

## The Judge: Crease

*Henry Pering Pellew Crease* was from a wealthy English military family, and possessed a prestigious law background. 

* His social identity was above-all English, and this was made clear in his politics. 
* He viewed Canada not as a new society to be built, but as an extension of the british empire. 
* He displayed mistrust towards Canadians, referring to them as "North American Chinamen", afraid that they would "rule the country and job its offices" (Tina Loo).


## Another Judge: Begbie {.smaller}

Parallel to Crease stood _Matthew Baillie Begbie_, another judge who testified alongside Crease in the 1884 Royal Commission on Chinese Immigration. 

- Unlike Crease, historical accounts describe Begbie as protective of marginalized peoples, particularly Indigenous communities and Chinese immigrants.  In the 1884 Commission, Begbie wrote that 

> "...four prominent qualities" of Chinese-Canadian immigrants were "industry, economy, sobriety and law abidingness," arguing this was the primary reason for their unpopularity amongst White Canadians. 

- Begbie struck down discriminatory municipal bylaws in Victoria that targeted Chinese-owned businesses, writing that such laws were  

> "...an infringement at once of personal liberty, and of the equality of all men before the law."

## What is the point of this presentation? 

In previous years, students expressed interest Crease's opinion on the 1884 Chinese regulation act, given that the regulation act was strongly condemned and ultimately struck down by Crease. 

* This seems at odds with Crease's position on Chinese immigrants.
* **Question**: Did Judge Crease strike down the act because of genuine anti-racism concerns, or because he saw the Chinese immigrant labor force as a valuable asset for growing the Canadian economy?

## Learning Objective

To demonstrate how historians can use computational tools to *help* them answer such a research question, by showing each step in the research process. 
:::


## Overview of Our Approach {.smaller}

We use machine learning techniques, specifically text embeddings, to offer a novel perspective on this question. We do the following:

1. Compile **a corpus of legal cases and commission reports** authored by contemporary judges concerning Chinese immigrants.
2. Apply **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** to the reports in order to convert them to a machine-readable format. 
3. Examine **keywords** in the texts, to compare the positions of different justices and regulations.
4. Use **machine learning** to assess the relative emphasis on economic versus social justice concerns.
5. Use **sentiment analysis** to evaluate whether the documents reflect pro-discrimination, neutral, or anti-discrimination positions.

This approach demonstrates different techniques historians can use to identify patterns in documents for analysis.

## Step 1: Collecting Data {.smaller}

We use 10 digitized texts: 

- Legal Documents that address Chinese immigration in BC during the period: 
    - *R v. Wing Chong* 
    - *Wong Hoy Woon v. Duncan* 
    - *R v. Mee Wah, R v. Victoria* 
    - *Chinese Regulation Act, 1884*
- Reports authored by Crease and Begbie for the Royal Commission that show the judges' personal perspectives. 
- The remaining documents enrich our corpus for analysis and supplement our study.

## Step 2: Optical Character Recognition {.smaller}

A big issue with working with historical texts is the format they're stored in: usually scans of varying quality from physical books, articles, etc. 

- **Challenge**: converting historical texts (often scanned images) into machine-readable formats (e.g., text files).
- **Benefits**: 
    - Enables computational research.
    - Broadens access to historical materials (easier to read and analyze than cropped scans).
- **Solution: Optical Character Recognition (OCR)**
    - Converts images of text into editable, searchable text.
    - Widely used in legal case repositories (e.g., Canlii).
- Many OCR tools exist, varying in cost, effectiveness, and ease-of-use.

## {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Early OCR (Pattern Matching):**
    - Compared each character image to a library of fonts and shapes.
    - Worked well for clean, printed text.
    - Struggled with handwriting, unusual fonts, or degraded scans.

::::

:::: {.column width="50%"}

- **Modern OCR (Intelligent Recognition):**
    - Uses AI to "read" text more like a human.
    - Analyzes shapes, context, and layout.
    - Handles messy, handwritten, or complex documents much better.

::::

:::

After testing several tools, we found that modern, AI-based OCR methods produced the most accurate results for our historical documents.

##

![](media/original_text.png)

---

OCR becomes even more challenging when our text is hand-written or contains unequally structured data as above.

- What do we do with the annotations on the sides?
- Or the title?
- Or the header?
- Or, worst case scenario, something like the following document.

---

![A page from a letter sent to Judge Begbie](media/bad_example.png)


## Step 3: Which texts should we use?

_Issue:_ How do we decide which of Crease's rulings to analyze?

- _Our goal_: build a profile for Justice Crease by focusing on his most relevant rulings.
- _Problem_: Not all of Crease's cases are about Chinese immigration; many deal with only loosely topics like railroad construction.
- We want to prioritize cases that tell us about stance toward Chinese immigrants.

## The Obstacle

* Many historical cases aren't easily searchable online (e.g., not on Canlii).
* Manually reading every case can be impractical.  
    * We need a systematic way to identify the most relevant texts.

## A simple approach

- Count the frequency of each word in Crease's rulings.
- Remove common filler words ("the", "and", etc.).
- The most frequent remaining words can reveal the main topics of each case.

*This gives us a quick overview of which cases are likely to be most relevant for our research focus.*

## Counting...


![Top words in three of our texts of interest, after removing common English stopwords](media/sample_top_words.png)

Unforuntately, just counting the top words isn't going to tell us much:

- The results are still flooded with common English words. 
- What we need instead is a **relative** measure of the frequency of each word in the texts. 


## A numerical interpretation of text {.smaller}

To analyze which themes are most prominent in each historical document, we use an ML method that highlights unusually frequent words in each documents.  This lets us:

- Identify key themes unique to each text.
- Avoid common words ("the", "and", etc.) that appear everywhere.
- Compare how different authors (e.g.,  Crease vs. Begbie) focus on economic or social language.
- Narrow down which documents are most relevant for deeper analysis.

This approach works best with a larger set of documents, as it becomes easier to spot words that are truly distinctive to each text.

--- 

![Results](media/tf_idf_results.png)

- We can see some of the specific themes surrounding each author's corpus (Begbie's pawnbroker case, for instance). 
- We now have a good idea of which texts are worth prioritizing for close readings, and which texts might not be as important. 
- Ultimately, the researcher can decide where to dig deeper.

## Alternatives {.smaller}

::: {.columns}
:::: {.column width="50%"}

### Word Embedding 

- Instead using just word counts, we could create *a multi-dimensional* "map", that calculates the relationships between each word in the historical texts. 
- In our "map," instead of latitude and longitude, each word is given a set of coordinates that represents its relationship to other words in the collection of texts. 

These coordinates created by analyzing all of the sentences, and learning each word's "meaning" through its surrounding in-text context. 

::::

:::: {.column width="50%"}

### `tf-idf` Method

- Words that are used in similar ways, like "china," "alien," and "chinese", are placed very close together in the same "neighborhood" on the map.
- In contrast, words like "statute" and "legislature" are placed close together, but are further away from "china," "alien," and "chinese".
- The the neighbors of a given word reveal the implicit associations of that word within the text.
- E.g., if a judge subconsciously favors wealthier litigants, words like "remorseful" and "cooperative" might cluster near affluent defendants, while "defiant" and "aggressive" cluster near poorer defendants.

::::

:::

## Applying to Our Question

_Our question_: Did Crease strike down the Act out of genuine concern for the rights of Chinese immigrants, or because he saw them as economically important?

- If motivated by social justice, we would expect his language to align closely with terms related to rights and equality.
- If motivated by economics, his language should cluster near economic and labor-related terms.

. . .

To explore this, we define two axes—"economics" and "social"—by averaging the positions of relevant keywords in our word embedding space.

- We then plot each sentence from the texts onto this plane to see which themes are most prominent in Crease’s language.

---

```
axes_map = {'social_issues': ['justice', 'equality', 'rights', 'fairness', 'discrimination', 'prejudice', 'persecution', 'humanity', 'dignity', 'compassion', 'liberty', 'protection', 'civil rights', 'human rights', 'alien', 'person', 'power', 'unconstitutional'],
            'economics': ['economy', 'economic', 'labor', 'commerce', 'trade', 'industry', 'railway', 'development', 'profit', 'wages', 'capital', 'prosperity', 'cheap labor', 'economic necessity', 'business', 'license', 'tax', 'fee', 'revenue', 'labour', 'employment', 'wage', 'miner', 'mining', 'land', 'goods', 'property', 'economic', 'industry', 'regulate', 'forfeit', 'penalty', 'pay']}
```
*Example of topic axes maps.*


## Results -- Social Score {.smaller}

Following this approach, let's take a look at the top 5 sentences with the highest **social scores**:


1. > "So far, I have dealt with the Act on its own merits; but if we consider it in juxtaposition to the Dominion Act recently passed restricting the Chinese throughout all Canada, its illegality becomes transparent; for in passing that Act against the Chinese the Dominion has spoken by the highest authority which it possesses—its own Parliament."

\

2. > "The grounds alleged by the Health Officer for this arbitrary treatment is ‘that China is an infected locality,’ and all persons coming from China and especially in this instance Hongkong, and especially also the natives of China, come from an infected locality, and that he has that authority under the Health By-Law, 1893, which was passed at the time of the small pox panic in Victoria, and, in all he did, was simply doing his duty."

\

3. > "There, an Act of the California Legislature passed an Act imposing a capitation tax ‘on ‘each person, male and female, of the Mongolian race of the age of 18 years and upwards residing in the State,’ accompanying a license almost a *fac simile* of our own, and enforced in much the same way as in the case before us, that, after long and elaborate argument in which the Attorney-General appeared for the State, was determined to be unconstitutional, as it was an interference with trade and commerce, which could be regulated alone by the general government."

\

4. > "The Act is found associated with another Act now disallowed, the express object of which is to prevent the Chinese altogether from coming to this country, and the principle 'noscitur a sociis' is kept up by the preamble of the present Act, which describes the Chinese in terms which, I venture to think, have never before in any other country found a place in an Act of Parliament."

\

5. > "It is very difficult, almost an impossibility, to fix any definite limit or even approximate of the proportion which Chinese immigration should bear to white immigration, if the best interests of the colony and the comfort of the people are to be regarded; and if only for this reason that no matter how many white people come to British Columbia, they all come expecting certain rates, rates which British Columbians have not got the money to pay."**

## Results -- Economic Score

Likewise, looking at the top economic scores:


1. > "It is very difficult, almost an impossibility, to fix any definite limit or even approximate of the proportion which Chinese immigration should bear to white immigration, if the best interests of the colony and the comfort of the people are to be regarded ; and if only for this reason that no matter how many white people come to British Columbia, they all come expecting certain rates, rates which British Columbians have not got the money to pay."*

\

2. > "Statutes were by their title and preamble expressly aimed at Chinamen by name; that this distinction also renders inapplicable all the United States' cases cited; that this enactment is quite general extending to all laundries without exception and we must not look beyond the words of the enactment to enquire what its object was; that there is in fact one laundry in Victoria not conducted by Chinamen on which the tax will fall with equal force so that it is impossible to say that Chinamen are hereby exclusively selected for taxation; the circumstance that they are chiefly affected being a mere coincidence; that the bylaw only imposes $100.00 per annum, keeping far within the limit of $150.00 permitted by the Statute; that the tax clearly is calculated to procuring additional Municipal revenue and that no other object is hinted at."   

\

3. > "All the evils arising from opium in British Columbia in a year do not, probably, equal the damage, trouble and expense occasioned to individuals and to the state by whiskey in a single month, or perhaps in some single night, As already observed, I do not remember ever to have seen a drunken Chinaman; and the argument against Chinamen founded on opium appears to be analogous to the comparison of the mote and the beam."

\

4. >"It is, perhaps, worth while to refer to the condition of labor in the Californian vineyards and hop-grounds as mentioned quite incidentally in the San Francisco Weekly Bulletin, 10th September, 1884, and consider what would be the effect on the development of our infant agricultural country if half its laborers, and of its powers of supply of laborers, were suddenly cut off."

\

5. >"The grounds alleged by the Health Officer for this arbitrary treatment is “that China is an infected locality,” and all persons coming from China and especially in this instance Hongkong, and especially also the natives of China, come from an infected locality, and that he has that authority under the Health By-Law, 1893, which was passed at the time of the small pox panic in Victoria, and, in all he did, was simply doing his duty."



## Comparing Judges

We see that 5 (social) is the same sentence as 1 (economic). Likewise, 2 (social) is the same as 5 (economic). 

* Many of the sentences classified as having a high social score likewise have a high economic score.  The numeric result is as expected!

![Word embeddings results](media/results_word_embeddings.png)

- Crease's language used in his cases and testimony is more closely associated to economic terms than social terms.
- Likewise, Begbie's texts align closer to the social axis than to the economic axis. 

## Sentiment analysis {.smaller}

Another interesting topic is the **sentiment** of each of the sentences in the cases.

- We can repeat our word embeddings approach, but this time add an additional two axes: a "positive" axis, created from a set of positive words, and a "negative" axis, created from a set of negative words. 

- A sentiment axis can thus be calculated by subtracting the negative value from the positive value for each of the sentences:

    - A sentence with a greater positive score than a negative score would have a overall positive value, meaning that the sentence has positive sentiment to it.
    - Likewise, if a sentence has a greater negative value than positive value, the overall sentiment is negative. 

**Issue**: Legal cases tend to not be overtly emotional. How will this affect the results?

## Results: positive sentiment

Let's start by looking at the top five most "positive" sentences in the collection of texts:

![](media/positive_sentiment.png)

Would you agree that the sentences here express positive emotion? 

## Results:  negative sentiment

![](media/negative_sentiment.png)

## {.smaller}

- **Observation:** The sentences with the highest negative sentiment are all very short.
    - Sentence embeddings are an average of all their words.
    - In longer sentences, emotional words are diluted by neutral context.
    - As a result, negative sentences tend to be direct and declarative.
    - Notice the smaller range of sentiment scores compared to social/economic scores.

Legal cases are not known for emotional language—so it's expected that sentiment scores show less variation.

* Still, the sentences identified as most positive or negative do make sense in context.


## Comparing Across Judges

![](media/sentiment_graph.png)

**Observation:** Across all authors and dimensions, sentences with positive sentiment have higher alignment scores.

## Conclusion {.smaller}

- Our analysis suggests that Justice Crease's ruling was driven more by economic ideas rather than social justice concerns, which stands in contrast to the more "rights-focused" language used by his contemporary, Justice Begbie.

- Machine learning methods are a tool for historical inquiry, not an end in themselves. They help identify and quantify linguistic patterns, but they do **not** replace a historian's qualitative judgment and interpretation.

- These findings are are based on a small dataset of a few documents, and are meant to illustrate possible uses, rather than come to a definitive  conclusion.
    - With a larger and more comprehensive corpus of legal texts (such as Crease's & Begbie's personal letters, which are a lot harder to OCR), the model's understanding of the period's language would improve, and the results might change. 
    - This approach can also be supplemented by deep reading of the texts.
